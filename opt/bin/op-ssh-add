$0: A wrapper around ssh-add that uses the 1Password SSH_AUTH_SOCK

See https://support.1password.com/ssh-socket/#use-the-ssh-agent-with-1password
for more information about 1Password as an SSH agent.

See the ssh-add manual page for more information about ssh-add.

If the 1Password agent is not running, this script will fail.

For op-ssh-help (this message) simply run the command with no arguments.

All arguments are passed directly to ssh-add.
