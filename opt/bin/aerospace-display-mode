Usage: $0 <MODE>
Set the indicator for the AeroSpace display mode.

ARGUMENTS
    MODE    The mode to set.
            init:
                Launch the required applications and set the indicators to orange.
                This is used when AeroSpace starts up.
            main:
                Set the indicator to green, indicating the main mode,
                where keyboard input is processed normally.
            other:
                Set the indicator to red, indicating one of the alternative modes.

Note that only the "init" mode will launch AnyBar and pass all params to borders.
borders in particular is noticeably slower to process all its arguments,
but passing just the active_color is fast enough to not cause any noticeable delay.
