# Xming Server Resource File
# 
# This file is read only as ~/Xmingrc - not .Xmingrc. Gah. Very litte of (this version of) 
# this file is Interix-specific, but at least xterm.bat is.
# 
# Some shit: 
# Xming throws a fit if comments are #blah. You MUST use a between the # and text. WTF Xming. 
# Do not put quotation marks of any kind in comments
# If you remove a Menu entry, you must also remove any references to it. THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE. Err... maybe.
