# .atom/packages

We are handling package syncing - which is not possible without using an Atom plugin - using the `package-sync` plugin.

- When installing Atom on a new machine, install that package and tell it to sync
- After installing a new package, it should automatically update the `packages.cson` file; double check, then commit
