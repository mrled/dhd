# Hammerspoon config

I got the original implementation of termdraw frmo [this post](https://blog.theodo.com/2018/03/making-runtime-funtime-hammerspoon/).
My improvements include refusing to create a new terminal if the window is under a certain size
(hard coded for now)
and showing in red when the dragged area is under that size.

See a demo here:

You can also see a much better quality video here:
