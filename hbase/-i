This file is here to prevent 'rm -r /path/to/somewhere/ *'...
	(which deletes '/path/to/somewhere' AND '*')
when all you meant to do was 'rm -r /path/to/somewhere/*'
	(which deletes '*' in '/path/to/somewhere')

This way, if you do the fist one in a directory with this file, it sees 
this file (named -i) and thinks that its an argument. The -i argument 
happens to be --interactive; that is, it will ask you for each file 
whether you want to remove it. hehe.

To make this file, just do 'touch -- -i'
To kill this file, just do 'rm -- -i'

MegaProps to kapheine on forums.gentoo.org for this one. Ingenious.
