Just to reply to myself, the 1800-24G (SKU 7115886) that actually does
have 22 10/100/1000 ports (plus the 2 dual-personality ports) is only
$369 list on PCMall.com. Hmmm...
(HP ProCurve) w/ radius auth (wait... is that 22 10/100 ??)
...
$ 300 is actually par for the course for similar non-Cisco gear.
DLink, Netgear, Linksys, Dell, etc all offer identically-configured
switches for the about same price.
3 of those vendors (DLink, Netgear, Linksys) are steaming piles of crap;
a Dell is tolerable while the HP would be the best of the bunch.
