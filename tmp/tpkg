# y'know... I've been thinking...
# maybe I can just put this in a shell script. 
# that way it won't have to load every time...

# my goals for this section:
# - to set the path properly (for those that require it, something special: eg, fink)
# - to have a utility for searching no matter what my package manager is
#	eg, if portage, then alias package to emerge -S (or if esearch, emerge package to esearch).
# I could have the package utility in a separate script, but I couldn't set the path there
# however, that would go well with my dynamic path setting (either below, or in an example somewhere, I forget where. 
# so I think I'm going to try that. hrm. 

# so I don't inherit anything silly
