# cygwin tcsh-ness
# i don't really know if uname reports cygwin on Windows, and I use SFU now 
# anyway

# this makes emacs' command: C-x C-c work properly (quit emacs)
# instead of be interpretted as C-x C-g. more info here:
# http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-emacs-windows/2002-10/msg00109.html
setenv CYGWIN "binmode ntsec stty"	# I don't know what does what here

# cygwin inherits the Windows path, so if your Windows path has this set, 
# it will be wrong (and you must set this in Windows for TortoiseSVN to work)
setenv SVN_SSH /usr/bin/ssh
