During Uni, (University of Queensland, in Australia) one of my best mate's Dave met a young blond by the name of Wendy.   From the start they just hit it off and you knew they would be together for always.About 3 years after they met, Dave came over to our place and told me he'd asked Wendy to marry him and that she'd said Yes.   Well, I immediately called the boys over, because we needed to all get very drunk and try to talk Dave out of this insanity.  During the night we were discussing various "special" things you could do for your loved ones.A couple of days later, Dave comes over excited as punch, and in the lounge room in front of me and Fred, drops his pants and flops his dick out.  "WHAT THE FUCK!, Dave what the fuck are you doing?""Check this out."  He then shows us the tattoo he got on his dick, "WY". "What?""Oh, hang on" and he rolls back the foreskin to reveal "WENDY".He got Wendy tattooed on his dick!  It was one of the "special" things we'd been laughing about a couple of nights ago.  We couldn't believe it!In any case, Wendy absolutely fucking loved it.About 6 months later we had the wedding and sent Dave and Wendy off on their honeymoon.  All the guy's in the team had chipped in what we could and we sent them to Jamaica.  A far cry from the Whitsunday's holiday they'd planned.Wendy and Dave loved it.Apparently during the 2nd week there, Dave was in one of the toilets along the beach and was having a piss in a urinal, when a big jamaican fella walked in.He, just glanced over and Holy Shit, this guy's got "WY" on his dick as well.Trying not to be rude, Dave asked,"Hey, have you got a girlfriend by the name of Wendy?""No Mon" the dude replied"Sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I noticed you have 'WY' on your dick, See here? See, I've got 'WY' on my dick too.  When mine's hard it says 'Wendy'."The dude looked at Dave, looked at his dick, looked back at Dave and said."No Mon, mine says 'Welcome to Jamaica, and have a nice holiday'."
