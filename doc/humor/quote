        IF PIZZA = LIKE BITCHEN AND GUY = LIKE TUBULAR AND
           VALLEY GIRL = LIKE GRODY**MAX(FERSURE)**2 THEN

What exactly is Peter Bowler's famous abecedarian insult? 

What, forgotten already? It is, of course, from Peter Bowler's peerless Superior Person's Book of Words (ISBN 0-87923-556-X), and goes like this:
Abecedarian insult, an: "Sir, you are an apogenous, bovaristic, coprolalial, dasypygal, excerebrose, facinorous, gnathonic, hircine, ithyphallic, jumentous, kyphotic, labrose, mephitic, napiform, oligophrenial, papuliferous, quisquilian, rebarbative, saponaceous, thersitical, unguinous, ventripotent, wlatsome, xylocephalous, yirning zoophyte." 

Translation: "Sir, you are an impotent, conceited, obscene, hairy-buttocked, brainless, wicked, toadying, goatish, indecent, stable-smelling, hunch-backed, thick-lipped, stinking, turnip-shaped, feeble-minded, pimply, trashy, repellent, smarmy, foul-mouthed, greasy, gluttonous, loathsome, wooden-headed, whining, extremely low form of animal life."

A truly scientific criticism never stops. No question is ever closed for it. When new facts appear or a new way of understanding old facts is shown, the critic is ready to reexamine, to modify or to overthrow his theory, if it does not account for all the facts in the most satisfactory way. For he is interested in the truth of his theory, and indifferent to the label, old or new, orthodox or heterodox, conservative, liberal, or radical, that others may place upon it.

in "Fifty-nine Deceits in Fahrenheit 911"...

Another Bush joke is presented as an obvious joke, although important context is missing. Near the end of the movie, Bush speaks to a tuxedoed audience. He says, "I call you the haves and the have-mores. Some call you the elite; I call you my base." The joke follows several segments in which Bush is accused of having started the Iraq war in order to enrich business. As far the movie audience can tell, Bush is speaking to some unknown group of rich people. The speech actually comes from the October 19, 2000, Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The 2000 event was the 55th annual dinner, which raises money for Catholic hospital charities in New York City. Candidates Bush and Gore were the co-guests of honor at the event, where speakers traditionally make fun of themselves.

Gore joked, "The Al Smith Dinner represents a hallowed and important tradition, which I actually did invent." Lampooning his promise to put Social Security in a "lock box," Gore promised that he would put "Medicare in a walk-in closet," put NASA funding in a "hermetically sealed Ziploc bag" and would "always keep lettuce in the crisper." Mary Ann Poust, "Presidential hopefuls Gore and Bush mix humor and politics at Al Smith Dinner," Catholic New York, Oct. 26, 2000. So although Fahrenheit presents the joke as epitomizing Bush's selfishness, the joke really was part of Bush helping to raise $1.6 million for medical care for the poor. Although many a truth is said in jest, Bush's joke was no more revealing than was Gore's claim to have founded the dinner in 1946, two years before he was born.

        This is where the bloodthirsty license agreement is supposed to go,

and explaining, in detail, the gory consequences if you do.
        We know that you are an honest person, and are not going to go around
pirating copies of Interactive Easyflow; this is just as well with us since
we worked hard to perfect it and selling copies of it is our only method of
making anything out of all the hard work.
        If, on the other hand, you are one of those few people who do go

      * Don't asterisks make you suspicious as all get out?  Well, all
        this means is that the IIc alone weights 7.5 pounds. The power
        pack, monitor, an extra disk drive, a printer and several bricks

Why do rasisins suck?

They stick together in huge globs like hibernating termites. 
They are supposed to be "nature's candy," but they don't have any cool gimmick like a whistle built in or being cigarette-shaped or super-sour flavor or any of the things that you actually want candy for. 
If you don't keep the box firmly closed, they will climb out and sing annoying Motown tunes on your kitchen table. 
They leave brown jellyish schmoo everywhere that looks like old chewing-tobacco spit. 
They are shaped like tiny black testicles. 

Raisins are itty-bitty dried fruit horrors. I say that you should avoid them at all costs. 

Plus, think about this. They take perfectly good GRAPES, and instead of making Beaujolais, what do they do? They mummify them, and turn them into little fiber bombs that rip through your lower colon like sharp gravel. 

Stay away from them or you could end up badly damaged. 

I heard when they exhume corpses, and open the caskets, that there is a little pile of raisins just sitting there, right where the bowels rotted away. Even the worms wont touch raisins.

In the arena of Little Things, we've been royally screwed by Life and the injustice is all the more stinging because your opulence is there for comparison. You have a numberless profusion of Little Things, all of which lure and fascinate us; our sometimes mocking your spillingly abundant collection of them is, in reality, nothing but simple invidia. Given the opportunity, a man will go through your handbag, dressing table drawer or bathroom cabinet. But we're not snooping on you, just exploring - through our envious tears - with childlike wonder. You have tiny brushes, twist-up lipsticks and eyelash shapers. You have all kinds of cases that hold pads and colours and foam tipped implements and that click shut satisfyingly. You have things we can't even work out what they are. We - hollow - go through it all, longing to be filled: men never get over the bitter, bitter resentment they feel because Nature has denied them the right to own a tampon applicator.

A curious young boy one day asks his father "What does a vagina look like?" The father kneels down and tells him "Well son, before sex the vagina looks like a beautiful flower ready to open." The son then asks "Well, what does it look like after sex?" The father pauses a moment and says "Well son, have you ever seen a bulldog eating mayonnaise?"

paper on its coverage of the event, and ended with "By the way, my family

 "We must take an unmovable stance on all issues where the Bible speaks plainly. What if people don't like such dogmatism? It is necessary anyway. Sound doctrine divides, it confronts, it seperates, it judges, it convicts, it reproves, it rebukes, it exhorts, it refutes error. None of those things is very highly esteemed in modern thought. But the health of the church depends on our holding firmly to the truth, for where strong convictions are not tolerated, discernment cannot survive."

The firefighter (who happened to be male, but could just as easily have been female) abridged the rights of the cat to determine for itself where it wanted to walk, climb, or rest, and inflicted his own value judgments in determining that it needed to be 'rescued' from its chosen perch. In callous disregard for the well-being of the environment, and this one tree in particular, he thrust the mobility-disadvantaged unfriendly means of ascent known as a 'ladder' carelessly up against the tree, marring its bark, and unfeelingly climbed it, unconcerned how his display of physical prowess might injure the self-esteem of those differently-abled. He kidnapped and unjustly restrained the innocent feline with the intention of returning it to the person who claimed to 'own' the naturally free animal.

I mean, the rhyme is pretty innocuous from that angle, anyway. From another angle, however, look at it!

/Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full.
One for the master, one for the dame,
one for the little boy who lives down the lane./

This is quite obviously a sinister indoctrination of established class structures, and the place of the proletariat within it.

Master and Dame represent the bourgoise aristocracy and the little boy, which represents the privilege of inheritance that perpetuates this system where the working class - the black sheep - is deprived of the fruits of their labour, instead it is literally shorn off him and redistributed amongst the rich. However, the way that the tale is told, demonstrates that the sheep is quite happy with this state of affairs, not realising that, in a workers paradise, the sheep would be free to keep his fleece to keep him warm on the cold nights in the pasture, rather than having it serve to clad the bourgoisie, who have never known the bitter cold of winter.

This nursery rhyme only serves to perpetuate the status quo, it is part of the propaganda used by the ruling class to preserve their status at the expense of the workers. I would contend, that if these ideological brothers and sisters of the revolution are keen to subvert the dominant paradigm, they ought not to tinker at the edges by changing "black" to "rainbow" in a superficial attempt to placate their middle-class guilt, they ought to go further.

If we are to persist in singing this inane quatrain to our children in our creches, I propose this revision:

/Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?
No, piss off, I'm keeping it all for myself, motherfucker./

Or something like that.

Mankind is like a king or queen in exile, and we cannot be happy until we have recovered our true state. What would you expect the Queen of a kingdom and the Beaury of the realm to fieel when she wakes to find herself a laundress in a foreign land? A woman's struggle with her sense of worth points to something glorious that she /was/ designed to be. The great emptiness we feel points to the great place we /were/ created for. It's true. All those legends and fairy tales of the undiscovered Princess and the Beauty hidden as a maid are more accurate than we thought. there's a /reason/ little girls resonate  with them so.

So, three guys get hired to work in a mine. One is Chinese, the other is
black and the last is white. The manager approaches them on the first
day to assign them their jobs for the upcoming weeks. He tells the black
guy that he is in charge of digging, the white guy is in charge of
handling and the chinese guy is in charge of supplies. The manager then
leaves to let them get to work. 
The next day the black and white guy awoke to find the chinese guy was
missing. He was gone for a few days before the manager came to check up
on their progress. He then asked why they haven't made any, and the
black guy responded "We can't work if we don't have any supplies", so
they went looking for the Chinese guy in the mine.
As soon as they entered the mine the Chinese guy jumped out from behind
them and yelled out "SUPPLIES!"

There was an island somewhere in the Pacific where every resident had
his or her own grass hut and lived in peace and harmony. The chieftan of
the island, being rich and all, had the only two story hut. One day, the
chieftan decided his hut, despite being two stories, was too plain and
undistinguished from the others, so he held a contest for the residents
of the island to design him the most exquisite throne they could conjure
up. Dozens of artisans and craftsmen presented their works, but the king
was never satisfied. He was a gracious king, so he politely thanked
every participant, but then he simply hid the thrones away on his second
floor. Finally, one day, a young woman brought him the perfect throne.
He couldn't believe his palace would finally feel complete. He set it up
in his living room and sat down to bask in his opulent royal glory, when
all of a sudden all the other thrones came crashing down from the second
floor and killed him.
The moral of the story?   
People who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.

He goes to his dad in the living room and says "Look dad, I'm a white boy." His dad slaps him hard in the face and says "Go show your grandmother."

The boy goes in his grandmothers room and says "Mira, abuelita, I'm a white boy". His grandmother slaps him in the face and sends him back to his mother.

His mother says "See. Did you learn anything from that?"

To which the boy replies, "Sure did. I have only been white for five minutes and I already don't like you Mexicans

A major airline's passenger cabin was being served by an obviously gay flight attendant, who seemed to put everyone in a good mood as he served them food and drinks.

As the plane prepared to descend, he came swishing down the aisle and announced to the passengers, "Captain Marvey has asked me to announce that he'll be landing this big scary plane shortly, so lovely people, if you could just put your trays up, that would be super."

On his trip back up the aisle, he noticed a well-dressed rather exotic looking woman hadn't moved a muscle. "Perhaps you didn't hear me over those big brute engines. I asked you to raise your trazy-poo, so the main man can pitty-pat us on the ground."

She calmly turned her head and said, "In my country, I am called a Princess. I take orders from no one."

To which the gay flight attendant replied, without missing a beat, "Well, sweet-cheeks, in my country, I'm called a Queen, so I outrank you. Tray-up, Bitch."

This morning, from a cave somewhere in Pakistan, Taliban Minister of Migration, Mohammed Omar, warned the United States that if military action against Iraq continues, Taliban authorities will cut off America's supply of convenience store managers.

If this action does not yield sufficient results, cab drivers will be next, followed by Dell customer service reps.

A guy comes in to the unemployment office, walks up to the counter, and says "Man, I hate taking welfare. All I want is a regular job, y'know?"

The social worker behind the counter says, "Your timing is Excellent.  We just got a job opening from a very wealthy old man who wants a chauffeur/bodyguard for his nymphomaniac daughter.  You'll have to drive around in his Mercedes, but he'll supply all of your clothes. Because of the long hours, meals will be provided. You'll be expected to escort her on her overseas holiday trips. You will have to satisfy her sexual urges. You'll have a two-bedroom apartment above the garage. The starting salary is $200,000 a year".

The guy says, "You're bullshitting me!"   
The social worker says, "Yeah, well, you started it."

Microsoft, bless their stupid little hearts, just really didn't see the

really "cute" that he could send people messages that would pop up

 Why GNU su does not support the `wheel' group

(This section is by Richard Stallman.)

Sometimes a few of the users try to hold total power over all the rest. For example, in 1984, a few users at the MIT AI lab decided to seize power by changing the operator password on the Twenex system and keeping it secret from everyone else. (I was able to thwart this coup and give power back to the users by patching the kernel, but I wouldn't know how to do that in Unix.)

However, occasionally the rulers do tell someone. Under the usual su mechanism, once someone learns the root password who sympathizes with the ordinary users, he or she can tell the rest. The "wheel group" feature would make this impossible, and thus cement the power of the rulers.

I'm on the side of the masses, not that of the rulers. If you are used to supporting the bosses and sysadmins in whatever they do, you might find this idea strange at first.

The last hurrah of the Book of Erotic Fantasy is an embarrassing Phil Foglio comic (which should be embarrassing enough on its own) in which he implies that the Book of Erotic Fantasy will actually inspire gamers to go out and meet women.

good reason. I have never met anyone who can do Scheme, Haskell, and C

than people with five years of experience in Java, but try explaining 
that to the average HR drone."

I'm getting the vapors.

I am still sick today, yet I am heading over to the comp lab to start (and hopefully) finish my Final Cut project which is due next Friday, because my week is so full that FCP should be the least of my worries.

I hope if my prof sees this, he feels the weight of conviction and guilt heavily upon himself.

*half hour later*

Uuunnnnnleesssssss the next project's files aren't around on the server, in which case I'll commend myself for making efforts to work ahead, and resolve to do it on Tuesday.
