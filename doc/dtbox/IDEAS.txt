 - make a .sh file which co/up's all my svn directories
   (if it sees them in an expected place, it up's; else it co's)
 - put all my scores files for dcrawl (etc) in one place, and them svn them around.
 - be cool to have a FF extension mapped to Ctrl-Alt-D which looks up a word via define:<word> 
   on google and then displays it for you (like mac os x dictionary)
 - also be cool to have a FF extension that looks up a word in wordnet & displays it. !
 - wordnet hotkey so that I don't have to keep the app running? stay in memory? 
 - svn c:\cygwin
 - create passphrases from weird snippets.
   "One of them's my wife and the other's my mistress."
   Don't take "and the other's my mistress" as the base of your passphrase
   take "them's my wife and the" as the base of your passphrase.
