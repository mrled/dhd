## Employment history

- Self-employed (January 2009 - Present)

    *Roles: Freelance tech support, IT consulting, and computer repair*

    I fix computer problems for individuals and manage small networks for businesses. I am solely responsible for the business, including advertising, customer relations, and actual tech support work. 

    I do a wide breadth of work, from Active Directory management to network hardware troubleshooting to individual user education. I routinely explain technical information to nontechnical managers and home users, with the goal that they know exactly what they need to make informed technical decisions about their business or personal data. I remove viruses, set up backup systems, and administer servers. 

    Accomplishments: 

- Neuric Technologies (May 2008 - Present)

    *Role: System Administrator*

    I work as sole administrator and tech support responsible for a network of several servers, including Windows-based Active Directory infrastructure, Linux email and shell servers, and firewall. I am responsible for information security 

    Accomplishments: I migrated the company from an OpenLDAP backend authentication system to Active Directory. 

- Neuric Technologies (September 2006 - November 2008)

    *Role: Staff Linguist*

    I worked as a linguist with a small team researching and proposing solutions for natural language parsing problems. A key component of this job was accurately communicating technical information to people who are not experts. 

    Accomplishments: I helped to design and build a model of the English language based on an inheritable predicate argument system of semantic roles. 


## Education

- B.A. Linguistics, University of Texas, 2008

## Other

I am interested in computer science/programming, as well as system administration. I use computers for fun, on my own time, and not just for games. I own and administer at least one Linux, BSD Unix, Solaris, IRIX, and soon an HP-UX system for personal interest.

I believe strongly in good documentation.
