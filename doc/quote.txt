Programmers don't actually write programs, they got too lazy for that long ago. Instead they write instructions for the computer on how to write the program, and when the computer follows these instructions ("source code"), it is called "compiling". Programmers usually pretend was done by them when they speak about it, as in "I recompiled the kernel for my exact CPU this time, and now playing pong is noticeably faster.".

When a pastor was asked if a person could go to heaven if he smoked, the pastor replied, "Sure... you probably will get there a lot sooner." Another pastor was asked if a person would go to hell if he smoked. The pastor replied, "No, you just smell like it!" Whether smoking is a sin or not, with all the information we now have, it is at the very least one of the dumber things we can do.

And it would be nice if it came with matching chopstick holder (WITH chopsticks). OH! and it CANNOT have any cartoon pictures, or be made out of plastic. It has to be made of ceramic, or something like that. Also it would be nice if it was made in japan. and not in china or corea (korea) or whatever.

The Chewbacca Defense
From South Park, Episode 214 "Chef Aid"
 - Judge Moses: Mr. Johnny Cochrane, your closing argument.
 - Johnny Cochrane: Ladies and Gentlemen of this deposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe his client wrote Stinky Britches ten years ago, and they make a good case. Hell, I almost felt pity myself. But Ladies and Gentlemen of this deposed jury, I have one final thing I want you to consider.
 - [Walks up to a chart stand]
 - Johnny Cochrane: Ladies and Gentlemen, (Pulls down picture of Chewbacca) this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wooky from the planet Kishic, but Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about it. That does not make sense.
 - Gerald (Whispering): Dammit.
 - Chef (Whispering): What?
 - Gerald (Whispering): He's using the Chewbacca defense.
 - Johnny Cochrane: Why would a Wooky, an eight-foot-tall Wooky, want to live on Endor with a bunch of two-foot-tall Ewoks. That does not make sense. But more important, you have to ask yourself what does this have to do with this case.
 - [Jury stares in silence]
 - Johnny Cochrane: Nothing. Ladies and Gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case.
 - [Gerald sinks back and covers his eyes]
 - Johnny Cochrane: It does not make sense. Look at me. I'm a lawyer defending a major record company and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and Gentlemen I'm am not making any sense. None of this makes sense. And so you have to remember when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation, does it make sense? No. Ladies and Gentlemen of this deposed jury it does not make sense. If Chewbacca lives on Endor you must acquit. The defense rests.
 - [Silence]
 - Judge Moses: OK then.

Feminism rocks!
Ok, try to follow this logic:
Feminism says that there is little difference between boys and girls
This leads to less that girls can identify with femininity
This means that girls only have their bodies left to identify as "differnt" from guys
So they show off their bodies to express feminity
Which means... good eye candy!

The cop got out of the car and walked to my friend window with his pen and ticket holding thing out. My friend rolled down the window, and this is the classic part. The cop says hello as he writes stuff down, and my friend kinda smiles at me. He looks at the cop and says " Are you writing me a ticket to the illinois state police ball?".

There was an old train conductor, and his name was Joe. He drove a train that used to pass by this way for a very long time. Joe was an alright guy, kinda near sighted though. But he was very proud and refused to get glasses to correct his vision. This caused all kinds of trouble for Joe throughout his career.

Why a few years back, Joe was navigating down the train tracks when there was a car stalled out in the middle of the tracks. Joe being near sighted didn't see it till it was too late. Obliterated the car. Unfortunately for Joe, that car belong to the local Mayor, and he had killed the Mayor.

Well Joe went on trial for killing the Mayor, and was convicted then sentenced to die in the electric chair. Joe served his time and was about to be strapped into the electric chair. The executioner comes up to Joe and asks him what his last request is. Joe asks for a Pink Banana.

Now Pink Banana's are pretty damn rare, and the only place to get them is this third world country in Africa. This country is REAL bad; Civil war, rampant murder, crime, gunfire you name it. But the executioner goes and smuggles out a Pink Banana for Joe.

The Executioner gives Joe his banana, and Joe eats it. They take him down to the execution room, strap him to the chair, then turn on the juice for a solid 3 mins. But Joe doesn't die. They all look at each other, determine that his sentence has been carried out and let Joe go.

So conductor Joe is back on his train again. Back to doing what he loves. He is going through another area of the state when another car is stalled in the middle of the tracks. Poor Joe doesn't see the car though till it was too late, and he demolishes the car of Senator (insert your senator).

Well, Joe is put on trial once more and convicted again. They sent him to the electric chair once more. Time passes and the time for his execution comes again. Joe is given once more a last request. Joe asks for a Pink Banana. Again to the third world country does the executioner go. Death, famine still rampant, but he sneaks out with a Pink Banana once again.

Joe eats his banana, and they set him up to be fried in the chair again. This time they decide to play it safe and electrocute him for a solid 5 mins. When they turn the power off, Joe is still alive! His punishment carried out, they have to let him go.

On the tracks is good old conductor Joe again, at the helm of his train again. Things are going good for Joe, and he thinks that everything is fine and dandy. When misfortune strikes once again for poor old conductor Joe. A car is stalled on the tracks in front of him. He runs over and kills the Vice president of the United States.   or insert other second in command type person for your country
This is pretty big now, and Joe is in a lot of trouble. The trial is quick, and they schedule is electrocution not to long after. On the day of his execution, the executioner left a note for Joe. "On my way to third world country for a Pink Banana, be back soon."

The executioner gets back with the Pink Banana, barely though. Almost got busted at customs, but he knew a few people and got through. Joe eats his banana with a hearty thanks and is taken down to the chair. Strapped in, they throw the switch and fry Joe for a solid 10 mins this time. But Joe still didn't die. Nothing else to do, the release Joe again.

Conductor Joe, knowing how to do nothing else gets back on his train. Driving down the tracks, Joe figures that he has to be through the worst of it. It can't happen again. Well, while he was pondering this, he drove through the president's car stalled on the train tracks.

Killing the President, is pretty big. And they have a 1 mins trial and sentence him to death by electrocution the next day. When Joe is being lead to the chair, the executioner greets him with a smile and a "long time no see Joe". He also already has a Pink Banana, since he went and got one as soon as he saw Joe in the news.

Joe eats his banana and this time the electrocute him for 20 mins straight. Afterwards Joe stands up out of the chair, brushes himself off and gets ready to go. Before he does, the executioner stops him and asks him a question.

"Joe," he says, "why is it that no matter how many times we electrocute you, you just don't die. Its really starting to bug me."

To which Joe simply replies, "Well, I guess I am just a good conductor."

So this big-shot Hollywood movie star buys a brand-new, bright pink Cadillac. And he's driving it everywhere, and every time anyone catches a glimpse of him he's behind the wheel of this huge pink thing. So naturally it becomes the latest fad, and pretty soon every car driven by everyone in the country is pink! Everywhere you look, there's somebody tooling up or down the road in his very own brand-new, bright pink Cadillac, or Honda or Toyota or what-have-you. But then, all of a sudden, springtime comes along, and almost overnight there has appeared a huge blanket of pollen from every flower and plant, and all the people come out of their houses to see that this layer of white pollen has covered everything in sight -- even their brand-new cars! And one neighbor sees his pink Cadillac covered in pollen, and he shouts across the street, "Hey! What's going on here?!" And another neighbor looks down at his own pollen-covered pink Cadillac, and he says, "It's pretty clear what we're dealing with here."
"Oh yeah?" says his friend, "What's that?"
"It's a white spore coat on a pink car nation!"

Resume Bloopers
 - "Revolved customer problems and inquiries." Just what every employer is looking for -- an expert in passing the buck. 
 - "Consistently tanked as top sales producer for new accounts." Sales managers aren't likely to be impressed with this self-proclaimed underachiever. 
 - "Dramatically increased exiting account base, achieving new company record." If customer accounts were leaving in droves as this statement implies, it's probably fair to assume that this candidate also tanked as a top sales producer. 
 - "Planned new corporate facility at $3 million over budget." Every hiring manager is searching for employees who exceed budgets by millions of dollars. 
 - "Directed $25 million anal shipping and receiving operations." Either this person is showcasing compulsively stubborn management qualities, or he has a challenging product packaging/storage problem. 
 - "Participated in the foamation of a new telecommunications company." This job seeker was also in charge of bubble control. 
 - "Promoted to district manger to oversee 37 retail storefronts." This is a common resume typo. There must be literally thousands of mangers looking for jobs in today's modern world. Here's a tip: Use your word-processing program's find/replace feature to quickly correct this common mistake. You can also modify your application's spelling dictionary so it won't recognize the word "manger." 
 - "Experienced supervisor, defective with both rookies and seasoned professionals." Many of us have had a boss like this at some point in our careers, but you usually don't find them being so up-front about their leadership inadequacies. 
 - "I am seeking a salary commiserate with my training and experience." There are a couple problems with this statement. To begin with, salary requirements don't belong on a resume. Secondly, a salary should be "commensurate" with experience (meaning proportionate to), not "commiserate" with (meaning to express sympathy for). 
 - "Seeking a party-time position with potential for advancement." Sounds like a fun job.

Translation: "Sir, you are an impotent, conceited, obscene, hairy-buttocked, brainless, wicked, toadying, goatish, indecent, stable-smelling, hunch-backed, thick-lipped, stinking, turnip-shaped, feeble-minded, pimply, trashy, repellent, smarmy, foul-mouthed, greasy, gluttonous, loathsome, wooden-headed, whining, extremely low form of animal life."

A truly scientific criticism never stops. No question is ever closed for it. When new facts appear or a new way of understanding old facts is shown, the critic is ready to reexamine, to modify or to overthrow his theory, if it does not account for all the facts in the most satisfactory way. For he is interested in the truth of his theory, and indifferent to the label, old or new, orthodox or heterodox, conservative, liberal, or radical, that others may place upon it.

in "Fifty-nine Deceits in Fahrenheit 911"...

Another Bush joke is presented as an obvious joke, although important context is missing. Near the end of the movie, Bush speaks to a tuxedoed audience. He says, "I call you the haves and the have-mores. Some call you the elite; I call you my base." The joke follows several segments in which Bush is accused of having started the Iraq war in order to enrich business. As far the movie audience can tell, Bush is speaking to some unknown group of rich people. The speech actually comes from the October 19, 2000, Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The 2000 event was the 55th annual dinner, which raises money for Catholic hospital charities in New York City. Candidates Bush and Gore were the co-guests of honor at the event, where speakers traditionally make fun of themselves.

Gore joked, "The Al Smith Dinner represents a hallowed and important tradition, which I actually did invent." Lampooning his promise to put Social Security in a "lock box," Gore promised that he would put "Medicare in a walk-in closet," put NASA funding in a "hermetically sealed Ziploc bag" and would "always keep lettuce in the crisper." Mary Ann Poust, "Presidential hopefuls Gore and Bush mix humor and politics at Al Smith Dinner," Catholic New York, Oct. 26, 2000. So although Fahrenheit presents the joke as epitomizing Bush's selfishness, the joke really was part of Bush helping to raise $1.6 million for medical care for the poor. Although many a truth is said in jest, Bush's joke was no more revealing than was Gore's claim to have founded the dinner in 1946, two years before he was born.

jwz: 		Padding. In this context that word means "lies," right? 
Alexis: 	Well I was trying to be a little more diplomatic than that.

Why do rasisins suck?

They stick together in huge globs like hibernating termites. 
They are supposed to be "nature's candy," but they don't have any cool gimmick like a whistle built in or being cigarette-shaped or super-sour flavor or any of the things that you actually want candy for. 
If you don't keep the box firmly closed, they will climb out and sing annoying Motown tunes on your kitchen table. 
They leave brown jellyish schmoo everywhere that looks like old chewing-tobacco spit. 
They are shaped like tiny black testicles. 

Raisins are itty-bitty dried fruit horrors. I say that you should avoid them at all costs. 

Plus, think about this. They take perfectly good GRAPES, and instead of making Beaujolais, what do they do? They mummify them, and turn them into little fiber bombs that rip through your lower colon like sharp gravel. 

Stay away from them or you could end up badly damaged. 

I heard when they exhume corpses, and open the caskets, that there is a little pile of raisins just sitting there, right where the bowels rotted away. Even the worms wont touch raisins.

In "10 things women should know about men", most of which are bunk, I came across this:

We covet your Little Things. We don't have all those Little Things; we have a deodorant and a shaver - that's it. In the arena of Little Things, we've been royally screwed by Life and the injustice is all the more stinging because your opulence is there for comparison. You have a numberless profusion of Little Things, all of which lure and fascinate us; our sometimes mocking your spillingly abundant collection of them is, in reality, nothing but simple invidia. Given the opportunity, a man will go through your handbag, dressing table drawer or bathroom cabinet. But we're not snooping on you, just exploring - through our envious tears - with childlike wonder. You have tiny brushes, twist-up lipsticks and eyelash shapers. You have all kinds of cases that hold pads and colours and foam tipped implements and that click shut satisfyingly. You have things we can't even work out what they are. We - hollow - go through it all, longing to be filled: men never get over the bitter, bitter resentment they feel because Nature has denied them the right to own a tampon applicator.

The firefighter (who happened to be male, but could just as easily have been female) abridged the rights of the cat to determine for itself where it wanted to walk, climb, or rest, and inflicted his own value judgments in determining that it needed to be 'rescued' from its chosen perch. In callous disregard for the well-being of the environment, and this one tree in particular, he thrust the mobility-disadvantaged unfriendly means of ascent known as a 'ladder' carelessly up against the tree, marring its bark, and unfeelingly climbed it, unconcerned how his display of physical prowess might injure the self-esteem of those differently-abled. He kidnapped and unjustly restrained the innocent feline with the intention of returning it to the person who claimed to 'own' the naturally free animal.

I mean, the rhyme is pretty innocuous from that angle, anyway. From another angle, however, look at it!

/Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full.
One for the master, one for the dame,
one for the little boy who lives down the lane./

This is quite obviously a sinister indoctrination of established class structures, and the place of the proletariat within it.

Master and Dame represent the bourgoise aristocracy and the little boy, which represents the privilege of inheritance that perpetuates this system where the working class - the black sheep - is deprived of the fruits of their labour, instead it is literally shorn off him and redistributed amongst the rich. However, the way that the tale is told, demonstrates that the sheep is quite happy with this state of affairs, not realising that, in a workers paradise, the sheep would be free to keep his fleece to keep him warm on the cold nights in the pasture, rather than having it serve to clad the bourgoisie, who have never known the bitter cold of winter.

This nursery rhyme only serves to perpetuate the status quo, it is part of the propaganda used by the ruling class to preserve their status at the expense of the workers. I would contend, that if these ideological brothers and sisters of the revolution are keen to subvert the dominant paradigm, they ought not to tinker at the edges by changing "black" to "rainbow" in a superficial attempt to placate their middle-class guilt, they ought to go further.

If we are to persist in singing this inane quatrain to our children in our creches, I propose this revision:

/Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?
No, piss off, I'm keeping it all for myself, motherfucker./

Or something like that.

Mankind is like a king or queen in exile, and we cannot be happy until we have recovered our true state. What would you expect the Queen of a kingdom and the Beauty of the realm to feel when she wakes to find herself a laundress in a foreign land? A woman's struggle with her sense of worth points to something glorious that she /was/ designed to be. The great emptiness we feel points to the great place we /were/ created for. It's true. All those legends and fairy tales of the undiscovered Princess and the Beauty hidden as a maid are more accurate than we thought. There's a /reason/ little girls resonate with them so.

So, three guys get hired to work in a mine. One is Chinese, the other is
black and the last is white. The manager approaches them on the first
day to assign them their jobs for the upcoming weeks. He tells the black
guy that he is in charge of digging, the white guy is in charge of
handling and the chinese guy is in charge of supplies. The manager then
leaves to let them get to work. 
The next day the black and white guy awoke to find the chinese guy was
missing. He was gone for a few days before the manager came to check up
on their progress. He then asked why they haven't made any, and the
black guy responded "We can't work if we don't have any supplies", so
they went looking for the Chinese guy in the mine.
As soon as they entered the mine the Chinese guy jumped out from behind
them and yelled out "SUPPLIES!"

There was an island somewhere in the Pacific where every resident had
his or her own grass hut and lived in peace and harmony. The chieftan of
the island, being rich and all, had the only two story hut. One day, the
chieftan decided his hut, despite being two stories, was too plain and
undistinguished from the others, so he held a contest for the residents
of the island to design him the most exquisite throne they could conjure
up. Dozens of artisans and craftsmen presented their works, but the king
was never satisfied. He was a gracious king, so he politely thanked
every participant, but then he simply hid the thrones away on his second
floor. Finally, one day, a young woman brought him the perfect throne.
He couldn't believe his palace would finally feel complete. He set it up
in his living room and sat down to bask in his opulent royal glory, when
all of a sudden all the other thrones came crashing down from the second
floor and killed him.
The moral of the story?   
People who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.

A plane is starting to crash, but everyone is very calm as the pilot

He and the stewardesses proceed to take all the bags and throw them out 
the side of the plane. The pilot comes back about two minutes later and 
says, "Well, it seems we still have to lose some weight. As much as it 
pains me to say, some of you will have to sacrifice your lives for the 
greater good of the rest of us. But not to be biased, we will be going
in alphabetical order. So will all the African-Americans please head to the

 Why GNU su does not support the `wheel' group

(This section is by Richard Stallman.)

Sometimes a few of the users try to hold total power over all the rest. For example, in 1984, a few users at the MIT AI lab decided to seize power by changing the operator password on the Twenex system and keeping it secret from everyone else. (I was able to thwart this coup and give power back to the users by patching the kernel, but I wouldn't know how to do that in Unix.)

However, occasionally the rulers do tell someone. Under the usual su mechanism, once someone learns the root password who sympathizes with the ordinary users, he or she can tell the rest. The "wheel group" feature would make this impossible, and thus cement the power of the rulers.

I'm on the side of the masses, not that of the rulers. If you are used to supporting the bosses and sysadmins in whatever they do, you might find this idea strange at first.

An airplane was about to crash. There were 5 passengers on board, but only 4 parachutes.

The 1st passenger said, "I am Kobe Bryant, the best NBA basketball player. The Lakers need me, and I can't afford to die." So he took the 1st pack and left the plane.

The 2nd passenger, Hillary Clinton said, "I am the wife of a former U.S. President, a NY State Senator and a potential future president. And I am the smartest woman in American history, so
America's people don't want me to die." She took the 2nd pack and jumped out of the plane.

The 3rd passenger, Ted Kennedy said, "I am a US Senator, the democratic party needs me and my liver still has some good years left." So he grabbed the pack next to him and jumped.

The 4th passenger, Billy Graham, said to the 5th passenger, a 10 year old schoolgirl, "I am old and frail and don't have many years left, and as a Christian I will sacrifice my life and let you have the last parachute."

The girl said, "That's okay. There's a parachute left for you. America's smartest woman took my school bag."

Dan Rather, Katie Couric, and a U.S. Marine Sergeant were all captured by terrorists in Iraq.
The leader of the terrorists told them that he would grant them each one last request before
they were beheaded.

Dan Rather said, "Well, I'm a Texan; so I'd like one last bowlful of hot spicy chili." The leader nodded to an underling who left and returned with the chili. Rather ate it all and said, "Now I can die content."

Katie Couric said, "I'm a reporter to the end. I want to take out my tape recorder and describe the scene here and what's about to happen. Maybe someday someone will hear it and know that I was on the job till the end."

The leader directed an aide to hand over the tape recorder and Couric dictated some comments. She then said, "Now I can die happy."

The leader turned and said, "And now, Mr. Marine tough guy, what is your final wish?"

"Kick me in the ass," said the Marine.

"What?" asked the leader? "Will you mock us in your last hour?"

"No, I'm not kidding. I want you to kick me in the ass," insisted the Sergeant.

So the leader shoved him into the open, and kicked him in the ass.

The Marine went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9mm pistol from under his flack jacket, and shot the leader dead. In the resulting confusion, he jumped to his pack, pulled out his M4 carbine and sprayed the Iraqis with gunfire. In a flash, all the Iraqis were either dead or fleeing for their lives .

As the Sergeant was untying Rather and Couric, they asked him, "Why didn't you just shoot them in the beginning? Why did you ask them to kick you in the ass first?"

"What?" replied the Marine, "And have you two assholes report that I was the agressor? I don't think so!"

First, let's establish a working definition of free markets; it's really simple. Free markets are simply millions upon millions of individual decision-makers, engaged in peaceable, voluntary exchange pursuing what they see in their best interests. People who denounce the free market and voluntary exchange, and are for control and coercion, believe they have more intelligence and superior wisdom than the masses. What's more, they believe they've been ordained to forcibly impose that wisdom on the rest of us. Of course, they have what they consider good reasons for doing so, but every tyrant that has ever existed has had what he believed were good reasons for restricting the liberty of others.
Tyrants are against the free market because it implies voluntary exchange. Tyrants do not trust that people acting voluntarily will do what the tyrant thinks they ought to do. Therefore, they want to replace the market with economic planning, or as [some] call it -- industrial policy.

The following is a footnote in "Language Death" by David Crystal, page 46. Unfortunately I do not have the whole book, just an excerpt, so I can't go and look up what Dauenhauers is. The footnote: 
An anecdote reported by the Dauenhauers (1998: 96) deserves repeating: Jewish writer Isaac Singer was once asked in an interview why he wrote in Yiddish, as it was a dying language. 'So I like ghost stories', Singer replied. 'Also, I believe in the resurrection. What will all those Jews have to read when they come back to life if I don't write in Yiddish?'

Allowing people to own words would make life as we know it impossible.
Only certain people, those with the appropriate licenses, would be able
to talk about certain things. You wouldn't be able to talk or write
about genetics unless you held licenses to use repressor and allele and
so forth. You couldn't discuss syntax without licenses for E-language
and foot feature and Determiner Phrase, and if you had them, you might
find that you couldn't use, say, functional unification and thematic
role in the same paper because of the restrictions in the licenses
imposed by the proponents of rival theories. The mind boggles at the
insanity of this idea.
