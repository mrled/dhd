        IF PIZZA = LIKE BITCHEN AND GUY = LIKE TUBULAR AND
           VALLEY GIRL = LIKE GRODY**MAX(FERSURE)**2 THEN

What exactly is Peter Bowler's famous abecedarian insult? 

What, forgotten already? It is, of course, from Peter Bowler's peerless Superior Person's Book of Words (ISBN 0-87923-556-X), and goes like this:
Abecedarian insult, an: "Sir, you are an apogenous, bovaristic, coprolalial, dasypygal, excerebrose, facinorous, gnathonic, hircine, ithyphallic, jumentous, kyphotic, labrose, mephitic, napiform, oligophrenial, papuliferous, quisquilian, rebarbative, saponaceous, thersitical, unguinous, ventripotent, wlatsome, xylocephalous, yirning zoophyte." 

Translation: "Sir, you are an impotent, conceited, obscene, hairy-buttocked, brainless, wicked, toadying, goatish, indecent, stable-smelling, hunch-backed, thick-lipped, stinking, turnip-shaped, feeble-minded, pimply, trashy, repellent, smarmy, foul-mouthed, greasy, gluttonous, loathsome, wooden-headed, whining, extremely low form of animal life."

A truly scientific criticism never stops. No question is ever closed for it. When new facts appear or a new way of understanding old facts is shown, the critic is ready to reexamine, to modify or to overthrow his theory, if it does not account for all the facts in the most satisfactory way. For he is interested in the truth of his theory, and indifferent to the label, old or new, orthodox or heterodox, conservative, liberal, or radical, that others may place upon it.

in "Fifty-nine Deceits in Fahrenheit 911"...

Another Bush joke is presented as an obvious joke, although important context is missing. Near the end of the movie, Bush speaks to a tuxedoed audience. He says, "I call you the haves and the have-mores. Some call you the elite; I call you my base." The joke follows several segments in which Bush is accused of having started the Iraq war in order to enrich business. As far the movie audience can tell, Bush is speaking to some unknown group of rich people. The speech actually comes from the October 19, 2000, Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The 2000 event was the 55th annual dinner, which raises money for Catholic hospital charities in New York City. Candidates Bush and Gore were the co-guests of honor at the event, where speakers traditionally make fun of themselves.

Gore joked, "The Al Smith Dinner represents a hallowed and important tradition, which I actually did invent." Lampooning his promise to put Social Security in a "lock box," Gore promised that he would put "Medicare in a walk-in closet," put NASA funding in a "hermetically sealed Ziploc bag" and would "always keep lettuce in the crisper." Mary Ann Poust, "Presidential hopefuls Gore and Bush mix humor and politics at Al Smith Dinner," Catholic New York, Oct. 26, 2000. So although Fahrenheit presents the joke as epitomizing Bush's selfishness, the joke really was part of Bush helping to raise $1.6 million for medical care for the poor. Although many a truth is said in jest, Bush's joke was no more revealing than was Gore's claim to have founded the dinner in 1946, two years before he was born.

        This is where the bloodthirsty license agreement is supposed to go,

and explaining, in detail, the gory consequences if you do.
        We know that you are an honest person, and are not going to go around
pirating copies of Interactive Easyflow; this is just as well with us since
we worked hard to perfect it and selling copies of it is our only method of
making anything out of all the hard work.

      * Don't asterisks make you suspicious as all get out?  Well, all
        this means is that the IIc alone weights 7.5 pounds. The power
        pack, monitor, an extra disk drive, a printer and several bricks

Why do rasisins suck?

They stick together in huge globs like hibernating termites. 
They are supposed to be "nature's candy," but they don't have any cool gimmick like a whistle built in or being cigarette-shaped or super-sour flavor or any of the things that you actually want candy for. 
If you don't keep the box firmly closed, they will climb out and sing annoying Motown tunes on your kitchen table. 
They leave brown jellyish schmoo everywhere that looks like old chewing-tobacco spit. 
They are shaped like tiny black testicles. 

Raisins are itty-bitty dried fruit horrors. I say that you should avoid them at all costs. 

Plus, think about this. They take perfectly good GRAPES, and instead of making Beaujolais, what do they do? They mummify them, and turn them into little fiber bombs that rip through your lower colon like sharp gravel. 

Stay away from them or you could end up badly damaged. 

I heard when they exhume corpses, and open the caskets, that there is a little pile of raisins just sitting there, right where the bowels rotted away. Even the worms wont touch raisins.

We covet your Little Things. We don't have all those Little Things; we have a deodorant and a shaver - that's it. In the arena of Little Things, we've been royally screwed by Life and the injustice is all the more stinging because your opulence is there for comparison. You have a numberless profusion of Little Things, all of which lure and fascinate us; our sometimes mocking your spillingly abundant collection of them is, in reality, nothing but simple invidia. Given the opportunity, a man will go through your handbag, dressing table drawer or bathroom cabinet. But we're not snooping on you, just exploring - through our envious tears - with childlike wonder. You have tiny brushes, twist-up lipsticks and eyelash shapers. You have all kinds of cases that hold pads and colours and foam tipped implements and that click shut satisfyingly. You have things we can't even work out what they are. We - hollow - go through it all, longing to be filled: men never get over the bitter, bitter resentment they feel because Nature has denied them the right to own a tampon applicator.

A curious young boy one day asks his father "What does a vagina look like?" The father kneels down and tells him "Well son, before sex the vagina looks like a beautiful flower ready to open." The son then asks "Well, what does it look like after sex?" The father pauses a moment and says "Well son, have you ever seen a bulldog eating mayonnaise?"

PS:  I assume you know the story about Mr. Caspar Milquetoast, the
mild-mannered society figure, whose name was spelled "Casper" in a newspaper
story about one of his parties.  He wrote to the editor, complimenting the
paper on its coverage of the event, and ended with "By the way, my family
has always spelled my name 'Caspar,' but my relatives are notoriously poor
spellers."

 "We must take an unmovable stance on all issues where the Bible speaks plainly. What if people don't like such dogmatism? It is necessary anyway. Sound doctrine divides, it confronts, it seperates, it judges, it convicts, it reproves, it rebukes, it exhorts, it refutes error. None of those things is very highly esteemed in modern thought. But the health of the church depends on our holding firmly to the truth, for where strong convictions are not tolerated, discernment cannot survive."

The firefighter (who happened to be male, but could just as easily have been female) abridged the rights of the cat to determine for itself where it wanted to walk, climb, or rest, and inflicted his own value judgments in determining that it needed to be 'rescued' from its chosen perch. In callous disregard for the well-being of the environment, and this one tree in particular, he thrust the mobility-disadvantaged unfriendly means of ascent known as a 'ladder' carelessly up against the tree, marring its bark, and unfeelingly climbed it, unconcerned how his display of physical prowess might injure the self-esteem of those differently-abled. He kidnapped and unjustly restrained the innocent feline with the intention of returning it to the person who claimed to 'own' the naturally free animal.

I mean, the rhyme is pretty innocuous from that angle, anyway. From another angle, however, look at it!

/Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full.
One for the master, one for the dame,
one for the little boy who lives down the lane./

This is quite obviously a sinister indoctrination of established class structures, and the place of the proletariat within it.

Master and Dame represent the bourgoise aristocracy and the little boy, which represents the privilege of inheritance that perpetuates this system where the working class - the black sheep - is deprived of the fruits of their labour, instead it is literally shorn off him and redistributed amongst the rich. However, the way that the tale is told, demonstrates that the sheep is quite happy with this state of affairs, not realising that, in a workers paradise, the sheep would be free to keep his fleece to keep him warm on the cold nights in the pasture, rather than having it serve to clad the bourgoisie, who have never known the bitter cold of winter.

This nursery rhyme only serves to perpetuate the status quo, it is part of the propaganda used by the ruling class to preserve their status at the expense of the workers. I would contend, that if these ideological brothers and sisters of the revolution are keen to subvert the dominant paradigm, they ought not to tinker at the edges by changing "black" to "rainbow" in a superficial attempt to placate their middle-class guilt, they ought to go further.

If we are to persist in singing this inane quatrain to our children in our creches, I propose this revision:

/Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?
No, piss off, I'm keeping it all for myself, motherfucker./

Or something like that.

My uncle works for NASA. Years ago, he was called in to consult for the government on how to store some important data. Tape drives? CDs? (This was before DVDs.) His response was this: “If you write it on papyrus and lock it in a pyramid, we know it will last a few thousand years. Everything else is just guesswork.”

Mankind is like a king or queen in exile, and we cannot be happy until we have recovered our true state. What would you expect the Queen of a kingdom and the Beaury of the realm to fieel when she wakes to find herself a laundress in a foreign land? A woman's struggle with her sense of worth points to something glorious that she /was/ designed to be. The great emptiness we feel points to the great place we /were/ created for. It's true. All those legends and fairy tales of the undiscovered Princess and the Beauty hidden as a maid are more accurate than we thought. there's a /reason/ little girls resonate  with them so.
