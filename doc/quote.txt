Programmers don't actually write programs, they got too lazy for that long ago. Instead they write instructions for the computer on how to write the program, and when the computer follows these instructions ("source code"), it is called "compiling". Programmers usually pretend was done by them when they speak about it, as in "I recompiled the kernel for my exact CPU this time, and now playing pong is noticeably faster.".

When a pastor was asked if a person could go to heaven if he smoked, the pastor replied, "Sure... you probably will get there a lot sooner." Another pastor was asked if a person would go to hell if he smoked. The pastor replied, "No, you just smell like it!" Whether smoking is a sin or not, with all the information we now have, it is at the very least one of the dumber things we can do.

And it would be nice if it came with matching chopstick holder (WITH chopsticks). OH! and it CANNOT have any cartoon pictures, or be made out of plastic. It has to be made of ceramic, or something like that. Also it would be nice if it was made in japan. and not in china or corea (korea) or whatever.

The Chewbacca Defense
From South Park, Episode 214 "Chef Aid"
 - Judge Moses: Mr. Johnny Cochrane, your closing argument.
 - Johnny Cochrane: Ladies and Gentlemen of this deposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe his client wrote Stinky Britches ten years ago, and they make a good case. Hell, I almost felt pity myself. But Ladies and Gentlemen of this deposed jury, I have one final thing I want you to consider.
 - [Walks up to a chart stand]
 - Johnny Cochrane: Ladies and Gentlemen, (Pulls down picture of Chewbacca) this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wooky from the planet Kishic, but Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about it. That does not make sense.
i - Gerald (Whispering): Dammit.
 - Chef (Whispering): What?
 - Gerald (Whispering): He's using the Chewbacca defense.
 - Johnny Cochrane: Why would a Wooky, an eight-foot-tall Wooky, want to live on Endor with a bunch of two-foot-tall Ewoks. That does not make sense. But more important, you have to ask yourself what does this have to do with this case.
 - [Jury stares in silence]
 - Johnny Cochrane: Nothing. Ladies and Gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case.
 - [Gerald sinks back and covers his eyes]
 - Johnny Cochrane: It does not make sense. Look at me. I'm a lawyer defending a major record company and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and Gentlemen I'm am not making any sense. None of this makes sense. And so you have to remember when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation, does it make sense? No. Ladies and Gentlemen of this deposed jury it does not make sense. If Chewbacca lives on Endor you must acquit. The defense rests.
 - [Silence]

Feminism rocks!
Ok, try to follow this logic:
Feminism says that there is little difference between boys and girls
This leads to less that girls can identify with femininity
This means that girls only have their bodies left to identify as "differnt" from guys
So they show off their bodies to express feminity
Which means... good eye candy!

The cop got out of the car and walked to my friend window with his pen and ticket holding thing out. My friend rolled down the window, and this is the classic part. The cop says hello as he writes stuff down, and my friend kinda smiles at me. He looks at the cop and says " Are you writing me a ticket to the illinois state police ball?".

There was an old train conductor, and his name was Joe. He drove a train that used to pass by this way for a very long time. Joe was an alright guy, kinda near sighted though. But he was very proud and refused to get glasses to correct his vision. This caused all kinds of trouble for Joe throughout his career.

Why a few years back, Joe was navigating down the train tracks when there was a car stalled out in the middle of the tracks. Joe being near sighted didn't see it till it was too late. Obliterated the car. Unfortunately for Joe, that car belong to the local Mayor, and he had killed the Mayor.

Well Joe went on trial for killing the Mayor, and was convicted then sentenced to die in the electric chair. Joe served his time and was about to be strapped into the electric chair. The executioner comes up to Joe and asks him what his last request is. Joe asks for a Pink Banana.

Now Pink Banana's are pretty damn rare, and the only place to get them is this third world country in Africa. This country is REAL bad; Civil war, rampant murder, crime, gunfire you name it. But the executioner goes and smuggles out a Pink Banana for Joe.

The Executioner gives Joe his banana, and Joe eats it. They take him down to the execution room, strap him to the chair, then turn on the juice for a solid 3 mins. But Joe doesn't die. They all look at each other, determine that his sentence has been carried out and let Joe go.

So conductor Joe is back on his train again. Back to doing what he loves. He is going through another area of the state when another car is stalled in the middle of the tracks. Poor Joe doesn't see the car though till it was too late, and he demolishes the car of Senator (insert your senator).

Well, Joe is put on trial once more and convicted again. They sent him to the electric chair once more. Time passes and the time for his execution comes again. Joe is given once more a last request. Joe asks for a Pink Banana. Again to the third world country does the executioner go. Death, famine still rampant, but he sneaks out with a Pink Banana once again.

Joe eats his banana, and they set him up to be fried in the chair again. This time they decide to play it safe and electrocute him for a solid 5 mins. When they turn the power off, Joe is still alive! His punishment carried out, they have to let him go.

On the tracks is good old conductor Joe again, at the helm of his train again. Things are going good for Joe, and he thinks that everything is fine and dandy. When misfortune strikes once again for poor old conductor Joe. A car is stalled on the tracks in front of him. He runs over and kills the Vice president of the United States.   or insert other second in command type person for your country
This is pretty big now, and Joe is in a lot of trouble. The trial is quick, and they schedule is electrocution not to long after. On the day of his execution, the executioner left a note for Joe. "On my way to third world country for a Pink Banana, be back soon."

The executioner gets back with the Pink Banana, barely though. Almost got busted at customs, but he knew a few people and got through. Joe eats his banana with a hearty thanks and is taken down to the chair. Strapped in, they throw the switch and fry Joe for a solid 10 mins this time. But Joe still didn't die. Nothing else to do, the release Joe again.

Conductor Joe, knowing how to do nothing else gets back on his train. Driving down the tracks, Joe figures that he has to be through the worst of it. It can't happen again. Well, while he was pondering this, he drove through the president's car stalled on the train tracks.

Killing the President, is pretty big. And they have a 1 mins trial and sentence him to death by electrocution the next day. When Joe is being lead to the chair, the executioner greets him with a smile and a "long time no see Joe". He also already has a Pink Banana, since he went and got one as soon as he saw Joe in the news.

Joe eats his banana and this time the electrocute him for 20 mins straight. Afterwards Joe stands up out of the chair, brushes himself off and gets ready to go. Before he does, the executioner stops him and asks him a question.

"Joe," he says, "why is it that no matter how many times we electrocute you, you just don't die. Its really starting to bug me."

To which Joe simply replies, "Well, I guess I am just a good conductor."

So this big-shot Hollywood movie star buys a brand-new, bright pink Cadillac. And he's driving it everywhere, and every time anyone catches a glimpse of him he's behind the wheel of this huge pink thing. So naturally it becomes the latest fad, and pretty soon every car driven by everyone in the country is pink! Everywhere you look, there's somebody tooling up or down the road in his very own brand-new, bright pink Cadillac, or Honda or Toyota or what-have-you. But then, all of a sudden, springtime comes along, and almost overnight there has appeared a huge blanket of pollen from every flower and plant, and all the people come out of their houses to see that this layer of white pollen has covered everything in sight -- even their brand-new cars! And one neighbor sees his pink Cadillac covered in pollen, and he shouts across the street, "Hey! What's going on here?!" And another neighbor looks down at his own pollen-covered pink Cadillac, and he says, "It's pretty clear what we're dealing with here."
"Oh yeah?" says his friend, "What's that?"
"It's a white spore coat on a pink car nation!"

Resume Bloopers
 - "Revolved customer problems and inquiries." Just what every employer is looking for -- an expert in passing the buck. 
 - "Consistently tanked as top sales producer for new accounts." Sales managers aren't likely to be impressed with this self-proclaimed underachiever. 
 - "Dramatically increased exiting account base, achieving new company record." If customer accounts were leaving in droves as this statement implies, it's probably fair to assume that this candidate also tanked as a top sales producer. 
 - "Planned new corporate facility at $3 million over budget." Every hiring manager is searching for employees who exceed budgets by millions of dollars. 
 - "Directed $25 million anal shipping and receiving operations." Either this person is showcasing compulsively stubborn management qualities, or he has a challenging product packaging/storage problem. 
 - "Participated in the foamation of a new telecommunications company." This job seeker was also in charge of bubble control. 
 - "Promoted to district manger to oversee 37 retail storefronts." This is a common resume typo. There must be literally thousands of mangers looking for jobs in today's modern world. Here's a tip: Use your word-processing program's find/place feature to quickly correct this common mistake. You can also modify your application's spelling dictionary so it won't recognize the word "manger." 
 - "Experienced supervisor, defective with both rookies and seasoned professionals." Many of us have had a boss like this at some point in our careers, but you usually don't find them being so up-front about their leadership inadequacies. 
 - "I am seeking a salary commiserate with my training and experience." There are a couple problems with this statement. To begin with, salary requirements don't belong on a resume. Secondly, a salary should be "commensurate" with experience (meaning proportionate to), not "commiserate" with (meaning to express sympathy for). 
 - "Seeking a party-time position with potential for advancement." Sounds like a fun job.

Translation: "Sir, you are an impotent, conceited, obscene, hairy-buttocked, brainless, wicked, toadying, goatish, indecent, stable-smelling, hunch-backed, thick-lipped, stinking, turnip-shaped, feeble-minded, pimply, trashy, repellent, smarmy, foul-mouthed, greasy, gluttonous, loathsome, wooden-headed, whining, extremely low form of animal life."

A truly scientific criticism never stops. No question is ever closed for it. When new facts appear or a new way of understanding old facts is shown, the critic is ready to reexamine, to modify or to overthrow his theory, if it does not account for all the facts in the most satisfactory way. For he is interested in the truth of his theory, and indifferent to the label, old or new, orthodox or heterodox, conservative, liberal, or radical, that others may place upon it.

in "Fifty-nine Deceits in Fahrenheit 911"...

Another Bush joke is presented as an obvious joke, although important context is missing. Near the end of the movie, Bush speaks to a tuxedoed audience. He says, "I call you the haves and the have-mores. Some call you the elite; I call you my base." The joke follows several segments in which Bush is accused of having started the Iraq war in order to enrich business. As far the movie audience can tell, Bush is speaking to some unknown group of rich people. The speech actually comes from the October 19, 2000, Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The 2000 event was the 55th annual dinner, which raises money for Catholic hospital charities in New York City. Candidates Bush and Gore were the co-guests of honor at the event, where speakers traditionally make fun of themselves.

Gore joked, "The Al Smith Dinner represents a hallowed and important tradition, which I actually did invent." Lampooning his promise to put Social Security in a "lock box," Gore promised that he would put "Medicare in a walk-in closet," put NASA funding in a "hermetically sealed Ziploc bag" and would "always keep lettuce in the crisper." Mary Ann Poust, "Presidential hopefuls Gore and Bush mix humor and politics at Al Smith Dinner," Catholic New York, Oct. 26, 2000. So although Fahrenheit presents the joke as epitomizing Bush's selfishness, the joke really was part of Bush helping to raise $1.6 million for medical care for the poor. Although many a truth is said in jest, Bush's joke was no more revealing than was Gore's claim to have founded the dinner in 1946, two years before he was born.

        this means is that the IIc alone weights 7.5 pounds. The power
        pack, monitor, an extra disk drive, a printer and several bricks

Alexis: 	Well I was trying to be a little more diplomatic than that.

Why do rasisins suck?

They stick together in huge globs like hibernating termites. 
They are supposed to be "nature's candy," but they don't have any cool gimmick like a whistle built in or being cigarette-shaped or super-sour flavor or any of the things that you actually want candy for. 
If you don't keep the box firmly closed, they will climb out and sing annoying Motown tunes on your kitchen table. 
They leave brown jellyish schmoo everywhere that looks like old chewing-tobacco spit. 
They are shaped like tiny black testicles. 

Raisins are itty-bitty dried fruit horrors. I say that you should avoid them at all costs. 

Plus, think about this. They take perfectly good GRAPES, and instead of making Beaujolais, what do they do? They mummify them, and turn them into little fiber bombs that rip through your lower colon like sharp gravel. 

Stay away from them or you could end up badly damaged. 

I heard when they exhume corpses, and open the caskets, that there is a little pile of raisins just sitting there, right where the bowels rotted away. Even the worms wont touch raisins.

In "10 things women should know about men", most of which are bunk, I came across this:

We covet your Little Things. We don't have all those Little Things; we have a deodorant and a shaver - that's it. In the arena of Little Things, we've been royally screwed by Life and the injustice is all the more stinging because your opulence is there for comparison. You have a numberless profusion of Little Things, all of which lure and fascinate us; our sometimes mocking your spillingly abundant collection of them is, in reality, nothing but simple invidia. Given the opportunity, a man will go through your handbag, dressing table drawer or bathroom cabinet. But we're not snooping on you, just exploring - through our envious tears - with childlike wonder. You have tiny brushes, twist-up lipsticks and eyelash shapers. You have all kinds of cases that hold pads and colours and foam tipped implements and that click shut satisfyingly. You have things we can't even work out what they are. We - hollow - go through it all, longing to be filled: men never get over the bitter, bitter resentment they feel because Nature has denied them the right to own a tampon applicator.

In callous disregard for the well-being of the environment, and this one tree in particular, he thrust the mobility-disadvantaged unfriendly means of ascent known as a 'ladder' carelessly up against the tree, marring its bark, and unfeelingly climbed it, unconcerned how his display of physical prowess might injure the self-esteem of those differently-abled. He kidnapped and unjustly restrained the innocent feline with the intention of returning it to the person who claimed to 'own' the naturally free animal.

I mean, the rhyme is pretty innocuous from that angle, anyway. From another angle, however, look at it!

/Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full.
One for the master, one for the dame,
one for the little boy who lives down the lane./

This is quite obviously a sinister indoctrination of established class structures, and the place of the proletariat within it.

Master and Dame represent the bourgoise aristocracy and the little boy, which represents the privilege of inheritance that perpetuates this system where the working class - the black sheep - is deprived of the fruits of their labour, instead it is literally shorn off him and redistributed amongst the rich. However, the way that the tale is told, demonstrates that the sheep is quite happy with this state of affairs, not realising that, in a workers paradise, the sheep would be free to keep his fleece to keep him warm on the cold nights in the pasture, rather than having it serve to clad the bourgoisie, who have never known the bitter cold of winter.

This nursery rhyme only serves to perpetuate the status quo, it is part of the propaganda used by the ruling class to preserve their status at the expense of the workers. I would contend, that if these ideological brothers and sisters of the revolution are keen to subvert the dominant paradigm, they ought not to tinker at the edges by changing "black" to "rainbow" in a superficial attempt to placate their middle-class guilt, they ought to go further.

If we are to persist in singing this inane quatrain to our children in our creches, I propose this revision:

/Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?
No, piss off, I'm keeping it all for myself, motherfucker./

Or something like that.

Mankind is like a king or queen in exile, and we cannot be happy until we have recovered our true state. What would you expect the Queen of a kingdom and the Beauty of the realm to feel when she wakes to find herself a laundress in a foreign land? A woman's struggle with her sense of worth points to something glorious that she /was/ designed to be. The great emptiness we feel points to the great place we /were/ created for. It's true. All those legends and fairy tales of the undiscovered Princess and the Beauty hidden as a maid are more accurate than we thought. There's a /reason/ little girls resonate with them so.

So, three guys get hired to work in a mine. One is Chinese, the other is
black and the last is white. The manager approaches them on the first
day to assign them their jobs for the upcoming weeks. He tells the black
guy that he is in charge of digging, the white guy is in charge of
handling and the chinese guy is in charge of supplies. The manager then
leaves to let them get to work. 
The next day the black and white guy awoke to find the chinese guy was
missing. He was gone for a few days before the manager came to check up
on their progress. He then asked why they haven't made any, and the
black guy responded "We can't work if we don't have any supplies", so
they went looking for the Chinese guy in the mine.
As soon as they entered the mine the Chinese guy jumped out from behind
them and yelled out "SUPPLIES!"

There was an island somewhere in the Pacific where every resident had
his or her own grass hut and lived in peace and harmony. The chieftan of
the island, being rich and all, had the only two story hut. One day, the
chieftan decided his hut, despite being two stories, was too plain and
undistinguished from the others, so he held a contest for the residents
of the island to design him the most exquisite throne they could conjure
up. Dozens of artisans and craftsmen presented their works, but the king
was never satisfied. He was a gracious king, so he politely thanked
every participant, but then he simply hid the thrones away on his second
floor. Finally, one day, a young woman brought him the perfect throne.
He couldn't believe his palace would finally feel complete. He set it up
in his living room and sat down to bask in his opulent royal glory, when
all of a sudden all the other thrones came crashing down from the second
floor and killed him.
The moral of the story?   
People who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.

A plane is starting to crash, but everyone is very calm as the pilot

He and the stewardesses proceed to take all the bags and throw them out 
the side of the plane. The pilot comes back about two minutes later and 
says, "Well, it seems we still have to lose some weight. As much as it 
pains me to say, some of you will have to sacrifice your lives for the 
greater good of the rest of us. But not to be biased, we will be going
in alphabetical order. So will all the African-Americans please head to the

 Why GNU su does not support the `wheel' group

(This section is by Richard Stallman.)

Sometimes a few of the users try to hold total power over all the rest. For example, in 1984, a few users at the MIT AI lab decided to seize power by changing the operator password on the Twenex system and keeping it secret from everyone else. (I was able to thwart this coup and give power back to the users by patching the kernel, but I wouldn't know how to do that in Unix.)

However, occasionally the rulers do tell someone. Under the usual su mechanism, once someone learns the root password who sympathizes with the ordinary users, he or she can tell the rest. The "wheel group" feature would make this impossible, and thus cement the power of the rulers.

I'm on the side of the masses, not that of the rulers. If you are used to supporting the bosses and sysadmins in whatever they do, you might find this idea strange at first.

An airplane was about to crash. There were 5 passengers on board, but only 4 parachutes.

The 1st passenger said, "I am Kobe Bryant, the best NBA basketball player. The Lakers need me, and I can't afford to die." So he took the 1st pack and left the plane.

The 2nd passenger, Hillary Clinton said, "I am the wife of a former U.S. President, a NY State Senator and a potential future president. And I am the smartest woman in American history, so
America's people don't want me to die." She took the 2nd pack and jumped out of the plane.

The 3rd passenger, Ted Kennedy said, "I am a US Senator, the democratic party needs me and my liver still has some good years left." So he grabbed the pack next to him and jumped.

The 4th passenger, Billy Graham, said to the 5th passenger, a 10 year old schoolgirl, "I am old and frail and don't have many years left, and as a Christian I will sacrifice my life and let you have the last parachute."

The girl said, "That's okay. There's a parachute left for you. America's smartest woman took my school bag."

Dan Rather, Katie Couric, and a U.S. Marine Sergeant were all captured by terrorists in Iraq.
The leader of the terrorists told them that he would grant them each one last request before
they were beheaded.

Dan Rather said, "Well, I'm a Texan; so I'd like one last bowlful of hot spicy chili." The leader nodded to an underling who left and returned with the chili. Rather ate it all and said, "Now I can die content."

Katie Couric said, "I'm a reporter to the end. I want to take out my tape recorder and describe the scene here and what's about to happen. Maybe someday someone will hear it and know that I was on the job till the end."

The leader directed an aide to hand over the tape recorder and Couric dictated some comments. She then said, "Now I can die happy."

The leader turned and said, "And now, Mr. Marine tough guy, what is your final wish?"

"Kick me in the ass," said the Marine.

"What?" asked the leader? "Will you mock us in your last hour?"

"No, I'm not kidding. I want you to kick me in the ass," insisted the Sergeant.

So the leader shoved him into the open, and kicked him in the ass.

The Marine went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9mm pistol from under his flack jacket, and shot the leader dead. In the resulting confusion, he jumped to his pack, pulled out his M4 carbine and sprayed the Iraqis with gunfire. In a flash, all the Iraqis were either dead or fleeing for their lives .

As the Sergeant was untying Rather and Couric, they asked him, "Why didn't you just shoot them in the beginning? Why did you ask them to kick you in the ass first?"

"What?" replied the Marine, "And have you two assholes report that I was the agressor? I don't think so!"

First, let's establish a working definition of free markets; it's really simple. Free markets are simply millions upon millions of individual decision-makers, engaged in peaceable, voluntary exchange pursuing what they see in their best interests. People who denounce the free market and voluntary exchange, and are for control and coercion, believe they have more intelligence and superior wisdom than the masses. What's more, they believe they've been ordained to forcibly impose that wisdom on the rest of us. Of course, they have what they consider good reasons for doing so, but every tyrant that has ever existed has had what he believed were good reasons for restricting the liberty of others.
Tyrants are against the free market because it implies voluntary exchange. Tyrants do not trust that people acting voluntarily will do what the tyrant thinks they ought to do. Therefore, they want to replace the market with economic planning, or as [some] call it -- industrial policy.

The following is a footnote in "Language Death" by David Crystal, page 46. Unfortunately I do not have the whole book, just an excerpt, so I can't go and look up what Dauenhauers is. The footnote: 
An anecdote reported by the Dauenhauers (1998: 96) deserves repeating: Jewish writer Isaac Singer was once asked in an interview why he wrote in Yiddish, as it was a dying language. 'So I like ghost stories', Singer replied. 'Also, I believe in the resurrection. What will all those Jews have to read when they come back to life if I don't write in Yiddish?'

Allowing people to own words would make life as we know it impossible.
Only certain people, those with the appropriate licenses, would be able
to talk about certain things. You wouldn't be able to talk or write
about genetics unless you held licenses to use repressor and allele and
so forth. You couldn't discuss syntax without licenses for E-language
and foot feature and Determiner Phrase, and if you had them, you might
find that you couldn't use, say, functional unification and thematic
role in the same paper because of the restrictions in the licenses
imposed by the proponents of rival theories. The mind boggles at the
insanity of this idea.

The IBM/SCO lawsuit as the poisoning scene in the Princess Bride

SCO: So, it is down to you, and it is down to me...if you wish Linux dead, by all means keep moving forward.
IBM: Let me explain...
SCO: There's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I have rightfully stolen.
IBM: Perhaps an arrangement can be reached?
SCO: There will be no arrangements...and you're killing Linux.
IBM: But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
SCO: I'm afraid so. I can't compete with you physically, and you're no match for my brains.
IBM: You're that smart?
SCO: Let me put it this way: Have you ever heard or Kernighan, Ritchie, Torvalds?
IBM: Yes.
SCO: Morons!
IBM: Really! In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
SCO: For the kernel? To the death? I accept!
IBM: Good, then untar the source code. [SCO# tar -xvfz code] Inhale this but do not touch.
SCO: [taking a vial from IBM] I smell nothing.
IBM: What you do not smell is our patent portfolio. It is odorless, tasteless, and dissolves instantly in source code and is among the more deadly portfolios known to man.

IBM: [turning his back, and adding the patents to one of the code trees] Alright, where are the patents? The battle of wits has begun. It ends when you decide and we both compile - and find out who is right, and who is dead.
SCO: But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine it from what I know of you. Are you the sort of company who would put the patents into his own source code or his enemies? Now, a clever man would put the patents into his own goblet because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I am not a great fool so I can clearly not choose the code in front of you...But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the code in front of me.
IBM: You've made your decision then?
SCO: [happily] Not remotely! Because Linux's SMP code originally came from England(1). As everyone knows, England is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So, I can clearly not choose the code in front of you.
IBM: Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
SCO: Wait 'till I get going!! ...where was I?
IBM: England.
SCO: Yes! AH! And you must have suspected I would have known the source code's origin,so I can clearly not choose the code in front of me.
IBM: You're just stalling now.
SCO: You'd like to think that, wouldn't you! You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong...so you could have put the patents in your own code trusting on your strength to save you, so I can clearly not choose the code in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard, which means you must have studied...and in studying you must have learned that Man is mortal so you would have put the patents as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the code in front of me!
IBM: You're trying to trick me into giving away something. It won't work.
SCO: It has worked! You've given everything away! I know where the patents are!
IBM: Then make your choice.
SCO: I will, and I choose...[pointing behind IBM] What in the world can that be?
IBM: [turning around, while SCO switches goblets] What?! Where?! I don't see anything.
SCO: Oh, well, I...I could have sworn I saw something. No matter. [SCO laughs]
IBM: What's so funny?
SCO: I...I'll tell you in a minute. First, lets compile, me from my code and you from yours. [They both compile]
IBM: You guessed wrong.
SCO: You only think I guessed wrong! That's what's so funny! I switched branches when your back was turned! Ha ha, you fool!! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is never get involved in a land war in Asia; and only slightly less well known is this: Never go in against SCO, when intellectual property is on the line!

SCO: HA-HAHA-HAHA AH-HAHA-HAHA (!!) (THUD!)

[IBM removes the blindfold from Linux]

Linux: Who are you?
IBM: I'm no one to be trifled with. That is all you'll ever need know.
Linux: And to think, all that time it was your code that was patented.
IBM: They were both patented. I spent the last few years building up an impressive patent portfolio.

The IBM/SCO lawsuit as the prince/Westley scene from the Princess Bride: 

IBM lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side. Linux is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face.
Linux: Oh, IBM, will you ever forgive me?
IBM: What hideous sin have you committed lately?
Linux: I got 0wn3d. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
IBM: It never happened.
Linux: What?
IBM: It never happened.
Linux: But it did. I was there. Darl said, "All your code are belong to us."
IBM: Did SCO win its lawsuit?
BUTTERCUP: Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
IBM: Then you're not 0wn3d-- if Chewbacca has fur you must acquit (a pause) -- wouldn't you agree, Your Slimy-ness?
CUT TO: Darl, entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword, Boies.
Darl: A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
IBM: No. (a little pause) To the pain.
Darl: (about to charge, stops short) I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
IBM: I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Darl: That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
IBM: It won't be the last. To the pain means the first thing you lose will be your so-called trade secrets, below the ankles, then your copyrights at the wrists, next your patents.
Darl: -- and then my trademarks, I suppose. I sued you too slowly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
IBM: I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your market capitalization, followed by your investors--
Darl: (takes step forward) -- and then my customers, I understand. Let's get on with it --
IBM: Wrong! Your customers you keep, and I'll tell you why --
CUT TO: Darl. And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.
IBM: -- so that every shriek of every CIO at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish -- every IT manager that weeps at your approach, every system administrator who cries out, "Dear God, what is that thing?" will echo in the ears of your perfect customers. That is what "to the pain" means. It means I leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever.
CUT TO: Darl, doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him.
Darl: I think you're bluffing --
IBM: It's possible, pig -- I might be bluffing -- it's conceivable, you miserable vomitous mass, that I'm only suing you for infringment of four of my patents because I lack the interest in finding the thousands of others -- then again, perhaps I have the interest after all.
And now, slowly, IBM begins to move. His body turns, his feet go to the floor, he starts to stand --
CUT TO: Darl, staring, eyes wide.
CUT TO: IBM. And now he is standing, lawyers in fighting position.
IBM: -- DROP YOUR LAWSUIT!

Q: Why is feminism needed? Women are now socially seen as being equal to men, aren't they?
A: This world seriously needs feminism, real feminism! All around the world, women and girls are raped, prostituted, murdered, and/or -- in some countries -- denied some of their most important and basic social rights. Patriarchal religions are still well present in the society, try to impose their reactionary moralities and restrict women's sexual and reproductive rights. In the cases of pornography and prostitution, the oppression of women is even more dangerous because it is hidden from the public eye. Here, it happens on a sexual level, in intimate relationships, and pornography is central in enforcing that oppression.

I have no problems with educating kids on copyright law, so long as it's done correctly. In particular, I am opposed to "abstinence only" education. While it is true that abstaining from file sharing is an effective deterrent to its harmful effects (financial ruin, bankruptcy, incarceration if the RIAA gets its way), studies have shown that students in abstinence-only copyright education classes aren't any less likely to download copyrighted materials. Therefore, classes should also cover "safer" downloading practices, which effectively avoid the scrutiny of law-enforcement and reduce chances of being the victim of harmful effects of file-sharing. The use of encrypted connections and anonymizing networks such as Tor [eff.org], and basic techniques used to procure copyrighted material from newsgroups rather than insecure p2p protocols, etc., would all be covered in a well designed cirriculum.

"Cut it, posted it, put it up wit me own two hands. Think they call me MacGregor the fencemaker, but no, no they don't." He takes the shot.

The couple has no clue what to think of this drunk old man. But he is doing no harm and it's good to learn more about the locals.

Cum Dragon posted:

One quiet night I took my lady down to the lake for a romantic evening. We laid out the blanket and whispered to each other for just over an hour under the cover of the short-needle pines native to our area. I commented about a pungent smell there by the shore; it was the smell of decay. 

Then I felt the warm tingling that lets daddy know it's time to fuck. I firmly gripped my Fuckstick and made sure my aim was true. Soon, she was properly mounted. With each mighty thrust I felt the strangely rewarding sensation of my lover's body collapsing and snapping under mine. Crunch, crack, crunch, slurp, squish. After several minutes of frenzied pounding and penetrating, it was time to Cum. 

I allowed my eyes to be diverted from the moon (it's where I get my power) so that I might look into my darling's eyes while climaxing, but mere seconds before the magic ooze was to spasmodically erupt from my Dicksword, I came to a terrible realization. It was not my girlfriend that I had brought to the friendly shores of Tower Lake that night. No. It was, in fact, a cantaloupe that I had purchased that very same day. I don't know that there is a word to describe the way I felt that night, as I violently released my primal juices into the mushy remains of the brutalized fruit, but I know i'm not sorry. Thats for damn sure. I'm a Melon Fucker.

All of your ideas about love and sexuality have been shaped by a lifetime of semi-sleazy, exploitative experiences. But you think of them as normal, just like you think porn is a natural part of everyone’s life. You've never been raped, but you've grown up in a rape culture. 
 - oneangrygirl.net
%
When you're using porn, or hiring an escort, or watching a stripper, how can you actually know which girl you're getting? Do the girls wear labels that say “Need the cash for my heroin addiction” or “Quit my career in finance to do this instead”? Do the pornographers provide mini bios of the stars? No, they don’t. You have no idea who you’re getting,
Sure, you might be lucky once or twice and rent a video featuring a grad-school dropout, or score a lapdance from the ex-teacher who decided to try a second career as a stripper just for kicks. But we estimate that the majority of the time, you will be watching rape and incest survivors on the screen and stage. And if you’ve ever enjoyed a Traci Lords or Jenna Jameson video, you already have.

So, we live in a world in which men sell women to other men directly. And men also sell women to other men through mass media. These days, women are sometimes the buyers. And on rare occasions in recent years, women are the sellers. That is, there are women who consume pornography and a few women who make it. In this society, that’s called progress. Feminism is advanced, we are told, when women can join the ranks of those who buy and sell other human beings.

So maybe that’s why [Bill Gates] is able to truly understand mass disease in Africa. We look at the huge numbers and go numb. Gates looks at them and runs the moral algorithm: Preventable death = bad; preventable death x 1 million people = 1 million times as bad.

We tend to think that the way to address disease and death is to have more empathy. But maybe that’s precisely wrong. Perhaps we should avoid leaders who “feel your pain,” because their feelings will crap out at, you know, eight people.

Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastary in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.

Hiro used to feel that way too, but then he ran into Raven. In a way, this is liberating. He no longer has to worry about trying to be the baddest motherfucker in the world. The position is taken.
The crowning touch, the one thing that puts true world-class-badmotherfuckerdom totally out of reach, of course, is the hydrogen bomb. If it weren't for the hydrogen bomb, a man could still aspire. Maybe find Raven's Achilles' heel. Sneak up, get a drop, slip a mickey, pull a fast one. But Raven's nuclear umbrella kind of puts the world title out of reach.

Which is okay. Sometimes it's all right just to be a little bad. To know your limitations.

People are the most interesting content out there. If you’ve got a seriously shy nerd on your hands, try this: ask him how many folks are in his buddy list? How many friends does he have in Facebook? How many folks are following him on Twitter? LiveJournal? My guess is that, collectively, your nerd interacts with ten times more people than you think he does. He can do this because the interaction is via a system he understands — the computer.

Your nerd knows that people are interesting. Just because he can’t look your best friend straight in the eye doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to know what makes her tick, but you need to be the social buffer — the translation layer. You need to find one common thread of interest between your nerd and your friend and then he’ll engage because he will have found relevance.

 I don't know how to know who to trust, but I know who not to trust: old people. Our parents. Grownups. When they think of someone being spied on, they think of someone else, a bad guy. When they think of someone being caught and sent to a secret prison, it's someone else -- someone brown, someone young, someone foreign.

They forget what it's like to be our age. To be the object of suspicion all the time! How many times have you gotten on the bus and had every person on it give you a look like you'd been gargling turds and skinning puppies? 

What's worse, they're turning into adults younger and younger out there. Back in the day, they used to say 'Never trust anyone over 30.' I say, 'Don't trust any bastard over 25!'"

The way I see it, things like Hollywood, The Whole God Damn Music Industry and Web 2.0 cash cows, are industries that through some weird economy artifact became embarrassingly profitable for what they are. We are used to this and so we assume that it's perfectly natural to spend billions of dollars promoting some fucking pop band, or sinking ungodly amounts of cash into a movie productions or giving $50M to 3 kids working out of paul graham's basement. We may enter a world where:

- Becoming a rock star is about as profitable as being local symphony orchestra violinist
- Actors are going to be on the same pay-scale as the production's tax accountant
- Web 2.0 founder rock stars are going to have to settle for the micro-ISV lifestyle

To fix a car:

- Knowledge of a thousand different parts.
- Able to diagnose problems by sound or the customers' description.
- Tools. Different parts need different things. Even that thing you have to do something doesn't always work, so you have to get a longer thing to do it.
- Place to work. Crawling under a car isn't always so easy. Maybe their garage lets them go down some steps so they can stand up and work under your car, or they have a platform that raises the car way up.
- Alignments and balance? Putting on a new tire? The car guy always says they have to use special equipment to do that. Not just basic tools, but expensive, specialized equipment.
- Willingness to get really dirty.

To build a house:

- Tons of knowledge, plus keeping up to date on all the codes.
- Again, lots of tools. Tons of them.
- Lots of time.
- A partner to help lift many things.

To fix a computer:

- Access to google.com
- Not be blind
- A working hand.

That's about it.

This is normally a column about technology and technology business but I can’t help noticing that the global economy is in the toilet and not much rational thought is going into fixing the problem.  I don’t mean to insult the bozos currently pretending to run our economy or the new group of bozos about to take their places when the Obama Administration starts up this month, but my Mom could do a heck of a lot better job than either group and she’s 84 years old. 
...
So here's the problem.  Coming out of a credit bubble we have no credit.  People and businesses that HAVE money won't lend any of it to people and business who DON'T HAVE money so the economy suffers, enters a period of deflation, everything goes to hell and we lose our houses.  After that we're set up for an eventual period of inflation that none of us will be prepared to handle, etc., etc.  Against this the government's idea is to spend a lot of money to stimulate the economy, putting even more financial stress on our kids and their kids through $1 trillion deficits into the sunset.  And all of this is justified because of two ideas: 1) we don’t know anything else to do, and; 2) this way the same people who made the bubble are benefitting from its aftermath.

Funny story: while opening an account at Wamu, the banker asked me to give myself a PIN. I asked him how many digits it needed to be. He said that it could be 4, but up to ten. He recommended that I used 10 for the best security, and he remarked that's how long his was.

I asked him if his PIN was his phone number. He said it wasn't. Then I said, "well, then, it's you're parents phone number." He looked at me, paused for a few seconds, and then said "Well, I guess I have to change it now."

The worst, most infuriating part in my eyes is that when someone replies to you (thus autofilling your name/email address) and they STILL fuck up your name in the body of the e-mail. This is also after they've taken a good look at your sig! It's like they only trust the pedantic shithead in between their ears because that filthy mail directory couldn't possibly have spelled your name correctly.

Being a person with a relatively complex name, I'd have imagined that people would have spent the extra 2.4 seconds of brain-time to visually compare what they typed versus what my name actually is. Sadly they decide that my name isn't worth spelling.

There was a convention to discuss all of the achievements in science for the past decade. After their meetings, a group of scientists were talking and came to the conclusion that man no longer needs God. So they picked one from the group to go tell Him.

The scientist approached God and said, "Listen, we've decided we no longer need you. Nowadays, we can extract stem cells, clone people, transplant hearts, and all kinds of things that were once considered miraculous."

God patiently heard him out, and then said, "All right. To see whether or not you still need me, why don't we have a little man-making contest!"

"Okay, great!" the scientist said.

"Now, we're going to do this just like I did back in the old days with Adam," God said.

"That's fine," replied the scientist and he bent down to scoop up a handful of dirt.

"Whoa!" God said, shaking his head in disapproval. "Not so fast, pal. You get your own dirt."

As an aside, I read a short diatribe many years ago by a working mom whose kids were always asking her why they couldn't spend more money on entertainment purchases like video games. She was having trouble getting through to them, so one month she took her paycheck, went to a bank, and got it issued to her in 1-dollar bills. She took the bills home and piled them up on the table in front of her kids, who were amazed at the giant pile of money she had made. She then went through her budget with them, stacking the bills into piles by expense type: this many dollars for rent, this many for utilities, this many for groceries, this many for soccer uniforms, etc. At the end there were only a couple of dollars left, and the kids soberly realized that they needed to wait about 20 years and then start downloading games illegally online.

We called it the Rubber Duck method of debugging.  It goes like this:

1) Beg, borrow, steal, buy, fabricate or otherwise obtain a rubber duck
   (bathtub variety)
2) Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over
   some code with it, if that's all right.
3) Explain to the duck what you code is supposed to do, and then go into
   detail and explain things line by line
4) At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and then
   realise that that is not in fact what you are actually doing.  The duck
   will sit there serenely, happy in the knowledge that it has helped you
   on your way.

Works every time.  Actually, if you don't have a rubber duck you could at
a pinch ask a fellow programmer or engineer to sit in.

    I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible... The 1920s were the last decade in American history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics. Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of "capitalist democracy" into an oxymoron... I do not despair because I no longer believe that politics encompasses all possible futures of our world. In our time, the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms — from the totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes to the unthinking demos that guides so-called "social democracy."

Okay, I admit it, the command line is harder than the GUI. GUI-based administrative tools walk you through a process and offer tons of online help and wizards while they’re at it. The command line is definitely an acquired taste. But may I offer a very heartfelt bit of advice?

I used to have a boss named Rock. Rock had earned a degree in astrophysics from Cal Tech and had never had a job in which he used his knowledge of the heavens. Once I asked him whether he regretted getting the degree. "Actually, my degree in astrophysics has proved to be very valuable," he said. "Some things in this world are just hard. When I am struggling with something, I sometimes think 'Damn, this is hard for me. I wonder if I am stupid,' and then I remember that I have a degree in astrophysics from Cal Tech; I must not be stupid." 

Before going any farther [in this book], assure yourself that you are not stupid and that some things are hard. Armed with this silly affirmation and a well-rested mind, you are ready to conquer Cocoa.

A computer once beat me at chess, but it was no match for me at kick boxing.

Actually, my cd was released in 1985, in return for two German missionaries and a Dutch urologist.

At my lemonade stand I used to give the first glass away free and charge five dollars for the second glass. The refill contained the antidote.

England is better only because I stand out there as 'unusual'.

He taught me never to smile, which helps me when I visit disaster sites.

How many people here have telekenetic powers? Raise my hand.

I discovered my wife in bed with another man, and I was crushed. So I said, 'Get off me, you two!'

I got some new underwear the other day. Well, new to me.

I once had a large gay following, but I ducked into an alleyway and lost him.

I was sleeping the other night, alone, thanks to the exterminator.

I was the kid next door's imaginary friend.

I was walking down fifth avenue today and I found a wallet, and I was gonna keep it, rather than return it, but I thought: well, if I lost a hundred and fifty dollars, how would I feel? And I realized I would want to be taught a lesson.

I was with this girl the other night and from the way she was responding to my skillful caresses, you would have sworn that she was conscious from the top of her head to the tag on her toes. 

I'm a great lover, I'll bet. 

In our school you were searched for guns and knifes on the way in and if you didn't have any, they gave you some.

My classmates would copulate with anything that moved, but I never saw any reason to limit myself. 

My jokes are in my head and I have a duplicate copy of my jokes in a lot of British comics' heads, where they are safe.

My mother was like a sister to me, only we didn't have sex quite so often.

People always ask me, "Where were you when Kennedy was shot?" Well, I don't have an alibi.

Probably the worst time in a person's life is when they have to kill a family member because they are the devil. But otherwise it's been a pretty good day.

Some mornings it just doesn't seem worth it to gnaw through the leather straps.

The way I understand it, the Russians are sort of a combination of evil and incompetence... sort of like the Post Office with tanks. 

Well, my brother says Hello. So, hooray for speech therapy. 

When I wake up in the morning, I just can't get started until I've had that first, piping hot pot of coffee. Oh, I've tried other enemas. 

When I was a kid I used to pray every night for a new bicycle. Then I realised that the Lord doesn't work that way so I stole one and asked Him to forgive me. 

You don't appreciate a lot of stuff in school until you get older. Little things like being spanked every day by a middle-aged woman: Stuff you pay good money for in later life. 

You know what I hate? Indian givers... no, I take that back.

What struck me was this: young people seem to do the downloading, old people seem to do the anti-download complaining. I’ve seen claims that in the UK alone, £1.2bn is lost to illegal downloads. And I think there’s a fallacy there. It’s a bit like Rolex claiming lost revenues because people are buying rip-off Rolexes for $25. Does Rolex really think that someone who pays $25 for a “Rolex” is actually a potential customer for a $25,000 watch? I saw similar claims made for software purchases in India. So let’s put this in context. Does anyone really think that someone, anyone, downloads Cliff Richard illegally? Puh-leese.

.PST password security is horrible and can be broken in under a second by any number of freeware tools. I have to do this periodically for one of our more absent-minded users. Most recently I encouraged him to stop changing the password so we could just look up the hash from last time. He objected that it was not secure to keep anything protected by a single permanent, unchanging password.

I swear, single tear of pride ran down my cheek. Sure, it's irrelevent with a PST given the ease of password cracking, and sure he still writes the hash down on a post-it note and sticks it in his cupboard with the other three password-postits he uses, but he's getting the conceptual end of it. This must be what it feels like when your godchild graduates kindergarten or something.

In his book Bagombo Snuff Box: Uncollected Short Fiction, Vonnegut listed eight rules for writing a short story:

Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.
Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.
Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.
Every sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.
Start as close to the end as possible.
Be a Sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what they are made of.
Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.
Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To hell with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.
Vonnegut qualifies the list by adding that Flannery O’Connor broke all these rules except the first, and that great writers tend to do that.

I do this [double space after period] when the font I'm typing in is screwed up and I can't be bothered to change it back, because I can never convince myself that the tiny sliver of space some fonts allocate for a space following a period that looks like it's the same size as the space between the letters in a word is really going to come across on the other side looking like a space. So I double it up, because heavens, just imagine receiving an email in which the author had neglected to place a space after a period in electronic communication in our industry -- they'd be ostracized.

The nature of the personal computer is simply not fully understood by companies like Apple (or anyone else for that matter). Apple makes the arrogant assumption of thinking that it knows what you want and need. It, unfortunately, leaves the “why” out of the equation — as in “why would I want this?” The Macintosh uses an experimental pointing device called a “mouse”. There is no evidence that people want to use these things. I don’t want one of these new fangled devices.

It's hard for me to get inside the mindset of someone who would do this, but my only guess is that they feel it's the only way. They've given up on the idea that they have anything to offer another person, so they're looking for any way to cheat the system. The remote possibility of a brief, fleeting moment of intimacy with a woman who isn't even invested is the highest they believe they can aspire to, and the only reason they don't hire a prostitute is because they'd at least like to believe they accomplished something if not anything good.

It's a fresh cut of sad sandwiched between two slices of horrifying, with a spread of misogyny to taste.

quote:
Dear Sirs/Ma'ams,

I am Joss Whedon, the mastermind behind Titan A.E., Parenthood (not the movie) (or the new series) (or the one where 'hood' was capitalized 'cause it was a pun), and myriad other legendary tales. I have heard through the 'grapevine' that the Terminator franchise is for sale, and I am prepared to make a pre-emptive bid RIGHT NOW to wrap this dealio up. This is not a joke, this is not a scam, this is not available on TV. I will write a check TODAY for $10,000, and viola! Terminator off your hands.

No, you didn't miscount. That's four -- FOUR! -- zeroes after that one. That's to show you I mean business. And I mean show business. Nikki Finke says the Terminator concept is played. Well, here's what I have to say to Nikki Finke: you are a fine journalist and please don't ever notice me. The Terminator story is as formative and important in our culture -- and my pretend play -- as any I can think of. It's far from over. And before you Terminator-Owners (I have trouble remembering names) rush to cash that sweet cheque, let me give you a taste of what I could do with that franchise:

1) Terminator... of the Rings! Yeah, what if he time-travelled TOO far... back to when there was dragons and wizards? (I think it was the Dark Ages.) Hasta La Vista, Boramir! Cool, huh? "Now you gonna be Gandalf the Red!" RRRRIP! But then he totally helps, because he's a cyborg and he doesn't give a s#&% about the ring -- it has no power over him! And he can carry it AND Frodo AND Sam AND f@%& up some orcs while he's doing it. This stuff just comes to me. I mean it. (I will also offer $10,000 for the Lord of the Rings franchise).

2) More Glau. Hey. There's a reason they're called "Summer" movies.

3) Can you say... musical? Well don't. Even I know that's an awful idea.

4) Christian Bale's John Connor will get a throat lozenge. This will also help his Batwork (ten grand for that franchise too, btw.)

5) More porn. John Connor never told Kyle Reese this, but his main objective in going to the past was to get some. What if there's a lot of future-babies that have to be made? Cue wah-wah pedal guitar -- and dollar signs!

6) The movies will stop getting less cool.

Okay. There's more -- this brain don't quit! (though it has occasionally been fired) -- but I think you get my drift. I really believe the Terminator franchise has only begun to plumb the depths of questioning the human condition during awesome stunts, and I'd like to shepherd it through the next phase. The money is there, but more importantly, the heart is there. But more importantly, money. Think about it. End this bloody bidding war before it begins, and put the Terminator in the hands of someone who watched the first one more than any other movie in college, including "Song of Norway" (no current franchise offer). Sincerely, Joss Whedon.

I do not believe that you have the right to override an encryption. Because if you have the right to do it, everybody can do it. For whatever benign reason you have, somebody else has got one even more benign. But once you let one person deal in a digital copy -- and I don’t have to tell you; you know far better than I that, unlike in analog, the ten thousandth copy is as pure as the original -- it is a big problem. So once you let the barriers down for your perfectly sensible reason, you gotta let it down for everybody.

I don’t want to get into the definition of morality. I never said anything was immoral in what I was saying. I said it is wrong to take something that belongs to somebody else.

I tried something new today for coping with Rod and took an issue directly to him as though I were asking for suggestions. We need to have a phone jack installed in each location at the point of demarcation for a modem that will be used to manage the new T1s that are being brought in, and since we have no centralized collection of information about the phone system whatsoever I'm going to need to go to each location, find a suitable line, and connect the pairs to the jack. Not rocket science.

Rod was insisting that I use the phone lines our old phone company tech used to use to dial into our phone system, which may or may not still be active and are also connected to decaying toggle-switches that swap between an internal-only and external-only phone line for the maintenance dial-in. I suggested that instead of calling up his old buddy who wired the phone systems (Hi Dennis!) and hiring him for several days to figure out what those numbers are and whether they're still used and wiring up more badly-labeled-in-Sharpie switches that users would have to be trained on, we should just piggyback on an existing fax line and turn the fax off on the rare occasions that our ISP needs to dial into the modem. Over the next ten minutes his argument shifted so many times that he eventually ended up literally drawing me a picture of how to do exactly what I'd suggested we do in the first place, then sitting back with a satisfied smile.

I guess I win, but somehow this really feels like losing.

As a side note, I really hope you are not implying that these cities [Sodom & Gommorah] were rightly destroyed by God because men were marrying men and women were marrying women.  First of all, it's not biblically accurate.  Second of all, if that's what you think gays and lesbians deserve, I think you have strayed from the two most important commandments, according to Jesus, which are surprisingly not:
1. Don't be gay
2. Burn down cities where people are gay

But actually,
1. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your mind, and with all your strength and
2. Love your neighbor as yourself.

The bad news kept on coming like a rented thug rattling my ribcage. The CJ lowlife who squeaked out of town on a series of empty promises and bounced cheques? He's not here. His mom doesn't know where he is, his dealer says he ain't seen him, and his parole officer tells me it's the law to let him know where the guy is. I was sweatin bullets, 8 new users starting this week and about enough gear for each of them share a phone, a desk, and a keyboard not plugged into nothin. Budget says we had 12 machines, but all I can find is a cloud of moths and list of cigarette burned purchase orders.

Then it hit me like a ton of PSUs. The dame. The dame on his arm for the last three weeks. She liked the high life, SSDs, Blu-Ray drives, the whole works. She lived life to the hilt, FiOS, Versace, and an iPad for every room in the house. No way a broad like that had time for a schmoe like him on what I was payin him.

There was one place a paluka like me could go when the world made no sense, but some joes don't come back with anything more than a lotta questions and a lot less money.

I’m dismayed by the cult of originality — it sets up impossible, false expectations which fail to grasp what art is. Innovation is good, exploration is to be encouraged — they build on what’s gone before — but more often than not it’s enjoyable to simply experience an idea well-conceived, regardless of that idea’s source or its “originality.” And in the final analysis, were Star Wars or [Raiders of the Lost Ark] ever intended to be wildly original? No, they’re pastiche — valentines to the swashbuckling genres of yore. Kids, especially millennials, make a simple and honest mistake borne out of youth: they see Star Wars before they’ve seen its inspirations and assume it came that way fully assembled, direct from Lucas’ head. They witness result, not process. Then, growing as artists or cinephiles, their awareness gradually enlarges, the supporting armature begins to show — and because the film wasn’t what they’d originally dreamt (a total creation, which is an impossibility), they decide George Lucas isn’t worth the praise they originally foisted on him. Absolutely circular, and absolutely pointless.

It is far easier to destroy than to create.

I don’t know, like maybe a Midwest girl from a broken home, as a protest against political horrors, has sex with one stranger for every victim of global genocide? And she could be a vampire. We could call it Emotionally Deep Throat? Anyway, it’s just a jumping off point…

…maybe I’ll rethink this a bit.

I occasionally watch movies or television shows in which the f-word is used constantly, not by the criminal class but by supposedly elegant, well-educated, well-to-do people. The society I move in doesn't behave that way. Who imagines this? Maybe here in California. I don't know, you guys really talk this way?

I completely forgot about this, but there is a bug in the RDP audio stack where if you have a really busy terminal server with a bunch on concurrent sessions the audio streams get mixed up and for a really brief period (less than a second) you can hear the audio from someone else's session.

At my job this is usually porn.

This birthday party was exactly what I wanted: Playful and relaxing.  Sometimes you want a big blowout for your birthday, other times, you want a park, dogs, kites and babies. Other times still you want to blast dirty gangster rap from a boom box, and show everyone the latest dance moves you learned from Jersey Shore.  But then you think better of it. 

I believe this is what they truly mean about growing older and wiser.

And I’d just like to point out again that people who say “backslash” (or who write that copy for commercials) should be strung up, the flesh stripped from their bones, and their entrails fed to wolves. It’s 2011, folks. None of you have ever worked at a DOS terminal, so the word “backslash” shouldn’t even be in your vocabulary. ↩

... but since so much sexual slang involves meat—"hot dog," "sausage," "burger," "beef injection," "another beef injection," and so on—I thought this would be a fine occasion to point out that there are plenty of veggie alternatives:

Vegetarian-Friendly Sex Slang
Peeling the banana.
Tossing the salad.
Squeezing the melons.
Zeroing in on a grown man's nuts and nutsack.
Putting Monsanto in yoursanto.
Ordering the split pea soup.
Sorry, that's got ham.

Cornholing others.

Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.

Why is it that any time I post a "this is fucked up" story, someone asks, "why is anyone surprised?"

Do I type in a surprised tone of voice?

Is the internet presumed to be composed entirely of surprising things?

Received a CD-R in the post today. It contained a 700MB zip file. Inside the zip was a folder containing thirty smaller zip files. Inside each was one part of a multi-part zip.

Once I'd sorted it all out it produced a 700MB quicktime video of somebody working at his desk. He's just working away as normal for over an hour, then something happens on the screen. He points at the screen before looking into the camera and excitedly saying "See!", then the video ends.

The quality and the angle mean I can't read the screen and I don't recognise the software. Also I have no idea who this person is. Or where he is as I've never seen the office before.
