Programmers don't actually write programs, they got too lazy for that long ago. Instead they write instructions for the computer on how to write the program, and when the computer follows these instructions ("source code"), it is called "compiling". Programmers usually pretend was done by them when they speak about it, as in "I recompiled the kernel for my exact CPU this time, and now playing pong is noticeably faster.".

When a pastor was asked if a person could go to heaven if he smoked, the pastor replied, "Sure... you probably will get there a lot sooner." Another pastor was asked if a person would go to hell if he smoked. The pastor replied, "No, you just smell like it!" Whether smoking is a sin or not, with all the information we now have, it is at the very least one of the dumber things we can do.

And it would be nice if it came with matching chopstick holder (WITH chopsticks). OH! and it CANNOT have any cartoon pictures, or be made out of plastic. It has to be made of ceramic, or something like that. Also it would be nice if it was made in japan. and not in china or corea (korea) or whatever.

The Chewbacca Defense
From South Park, Episode 214 "Chef Aid"
 - Judge Moses: Mr. Johnny Cochrane, your closing argument.
 - Johnny Cochrane: Ladies and Gentlemen of this deposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe his client wrote Stinky Britches ten years ago, and they make a good case. Hell, I almost felt pity myself. But Ladies and Gentlemen of this deposed jury, I have one final thing I want you to consider.
 - [Walks up to a chart stand]
 - Johnny Cochrane: Ladies and Gentlemen, (Pulls down picture of Chewbacca) this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wooky from the planet Kishic, but Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about it. That does not make sense.
 - Gerald (Whispering): Dammit.
 - Chef (Whispering): What?
 - Gerald (Whispering): He's using the Chewbacca defense.
 - Johnny Cochrane: Why would a Wooky, an eight-foot-tall Wooky, want to live on Endor with a bunch of two-foot-tall Ewoks. That does not make sense. But more important, you have to ask yourself what does this have to do with this case.
 - [Jury stares in silence]
 - Johnny Cochrane: Nothing. Ladies and Gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case.
 - [Gerald sinks back and covers his eyes]
 - Johnny Cochrane: It does not make sense. Look at me. I'm a lawyer defending a major record company and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and Gentlemen I'm am not making any sense. None of this makes sense. And so you have to remember when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation, does it make sense? No. Ladies and Gentlemen of this deposed jury it does not make sense. If Chewbacca lives on Endor you must acquit. The defense rests.
 - [Silence]
 - Judge Moses: OK then.

Feminism rocks!
Ok, try to follow this logic:
Feminism says that there is little difference between boys and girls
This leads to less that girls can identify with femininity
This means that girls only have their bodies left to identify as "differnt" from guys
So they show off their bodies to express feminity
Which means... good eye candy!

The cop got out of the car and walked to my friend window with his pen and ticket holding thing out. My friend rolled down the window, and this is the classic part. The cop says hello as he writes stuff down, and my friend kinda smiles at me. He looks at the cop and says " Are you writing me a ticket to the illinois state police ball?".

There was an old train conductor, and his name was Joe. He drove a train that used to pass by this way for a very long time. Joe was an alright guy, kinda near sighted though. But he was very proud and refused to get glasses to correct his vision. This caused all kinds of trouble for Joe throughout his career.

Why a few years back, Joe was navigating down the train tracks when there was a car stalled out in the middle of the tracks. Joe being near sighted didn't see it till it was too late. Obliterated the car. Unfortunately for Joe, that car belong to the local Mayor, and he had killed the Mayor.

Well Joe went on trial for killing the Mayor, and was convicted then sentenced to die in the electric chair. Joe served his time and was about to be strapped into the electric chair. The executioner comes up to Joe and asks him what his last request is. Joe asks for a Pink Banana.

Now Pink Banana's are pretty damn rare, and the only place to get them is this third world country in Africa. This country is REAL bad; Civil war, rampant murder, crime, gunfire you name it. But the executioner goes and smuggles out a Pink Banana for Joe.

The Executioner gives Joe his banana, and Joe eats it. They take him down to the execution room, strap him to the chair, then turn on the juice for a solid 3 mins. But Joe doesn't die. They all look at each other, determine that his sentence has been carried out and let Joe go.

So conductor Joe is back on his train again. Back to doing what he loves. He is going through another area of the state when another car is stalled in the middle of the tracks. Poor Joe doesn't see the car though till it was too late, and he demolishes the car of Senator (insert your senator).

Well, Joe is put on trial once more and convicted again. They sent him to the electric chair once more. Time passes and the time for his execution comes again. Joe is given once more a last request. Joe asks for a Pink Banana. Again to the third world country does the executioner go. Death, famine still rampant, but he sneaks out with a Pink Banana once again.

Joe eats his banana, and they set him up to be fried in the chair again. This time they decide to play it safe and electrocute him for a solid 5 mins. When they turn the power off, Joe is still alive! His punishment carried out, they have to let him go.

On the tracks is good old conductor Joe again, at the helm of his train again. Things are going good for Joe, and he thinks that everything is fine and dandy. When misfortune strikes once again for poor old conductor Joe. A car is stalled on the tracks in front of him. He runs over and kills the Vice president of the United States.   or insert other second in command type person for your country
This is pretty big now, and Joe is in a lot of trouble. The trial is quick, and they schedule is electrocution not to long after. On the day of his execution, the executioner left a note for Joe. "On my way to third world country for a Pink Banana, be back soon."

The executioner gets back with the Pink Banana, barely though. Almost got busted at customs, but he knew a few people and got through. Joe eats his banana with a hearty thanks and is taken down to the chair. Strapped in, they throw the switch and fry Joe for a solid 10 mins this time. But Joe still didn't die. Nothing else to do, the release Joe again.

Conductor Joe, knowing how to do nothing else gets back on his train. Driving down the tracks, Joe figures that he has to be through the worst of it. It can't happen again. Well, while he was pondering this, he drove through the president's car stalled on the train tracks.

Killing the President, is pretty big. And they have a 1 mins trial and sentence him to death by electrocution the next day. When Joe is being lead to the chair, the executioner greets him with a smile and a "long time no see Joe". He also already has a Pink Banana, since he went and got one as soon as he saw Joe in the news.

Joe eats his banana and this time the electrocute him for 20 mins straight. Afterwards Joe stands up out of the chair, brushes himself off and gets ready to go. Before he does, the executioner stops him and asks him a question.

"Joe," he says, "why is it that no matter how many times we electrocute you, you just don't die. Its really starting to bug me."

To which Joe simply replies, "Well, I guess I am just a good conductor."

So this big-shot Hollywood movie star buys a brand-new, bright pink Cadillac. And he's driving it everywhere, and every time anyone catches a glimpse of him he's behind the wheel of this huge pink thing. So naturally it becomes the latest fad, and pretty soon every car driven by everyone in the country is pink! Everywhere you look, there's somebody tooling up or down the road in his very own brand-new, bright pink Cadillac, or Honda or Toyota or what-have-you. But then, all of a sudden, springtime comes along, and almost overnight there has appeared a huge blanket of pollen from every flower and plant, and all the people come out of their houses to see that this layer of white pollen has covered everything in sight -- even their brand-new cars! And one neighbor sees his pink Cadillac covered in pollen, and he shouts across the street, "Hey! What's going on here?!" And another neighbor looks down at his own pollen-covered pink Cadillac, and he says, "It's pretty clear what we're dealing with here."
"Oh yeah?" says his friend, "What's that?"
"It's a white spore coat on a pink car nation!"

Resume Bloopers
 - "Revolved customer problems and inquiries." Just what every employer is looking for -- an expert in passing the buck. 
 - "Consistently tanked as top sales producer for new accounts." Sales managers aren't likely to be impressed with this self-proclaimed underachiever. 
 - "Dramatically increased exiting account base, achieving new company record." If customer accounts were leaving in droves as this statement implies, it's probably fair to assume that this candidate also tanked as a top sales producer. 
 - "Planned new corporate facility at $3 million over budget." Every hiring manager is searching for employees who exceed budgets by millions of dollars. 
 - "Directed $25 million anal shipping and receiving operations." Either this person is showcasing compulsively stubborn management qualities, or he has a challenging product packaging/storage problem. 
 - "Participated in the foamation of a new telecommunications company." This job seeker was also in charge of bubble control. 
 - "Promoted to district manger to oversee 37 retail storefronts." This is a common resume typo. There must be literally thousands of mangers looking for jobs in today's modern world. Here's a tip: Use your word-processing program's find/replace feature to quickly correct this common mistake. You can also modify your application's spelling dictionary so it won't recognize the word "manger." 
 - "Experienced supervisor, defective with both rookies and seasoned professionals." Many of us have had a boss like this at some point in our careers, but you usually don't find them being so up-front about their leadership inadequacies. 
 - "I am seeking a salary commiserate with my training and experience." There are a couple problems with this statement. To begin with, salary requirements don't belong on a resume. Secondly, a salary should be "commensurate" with experience (meaning proportionate to), not "commiserate" with (meaning to express sympathy for). 
 - "Seeking a party-time position with potential for advancement." Sounds like a fun job.

So, it's that time of year again, when the four horsemen of the apocalypse - Hallmark, Teleflora, Hershey's, and network television - conspire against mankind by forcing us to acknowledge feelings we probably don't have, certainly don't understand, and definitely don't want to explore. 

Valentine's Day. When couples try and pretend that an arbitrary point in time will somehow hold emotional significance, and tide over the cracks in failing relationships. The time of year when baubles, trinkets, and cellulite-friendly sugar products turn men into knights on white steeds.

Listen. I'm not going to rehash the same old argument about going out,
smelling smoke, and smelling secondhand smoke. What pisses me off is
what made you get started on smoking. Every single fucking one of you
started smoking because it "looked cool". Every fucking one of you. I
can understand pot smokers because THC actually has an effect. Tobacco
has nothing, and everyone I've talked to says they always hated their
first cigarette. So you can fuck right off, you poser faggot.
