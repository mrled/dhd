some cygwin ideas:

not very important, but is it possible to install cygwin to c:\ ?

get all windows environment variables (http://kennethhunt.com/archives/000933.html is one list) and put them into the shell... so %WINDIR% becomes $WINDIR.

change %PROGRAMFILES% to C:\Programs
change %USERPROFILE% to ~/.WinProfile

specify a different folder for Documents and Settings at install time, see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/236621. I would probably make it a subdir of C:\cygwin\home
