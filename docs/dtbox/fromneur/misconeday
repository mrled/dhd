Guys are a bit gabbier in Dutch, too

Allowing people to own words would make life as we know it impossible.
Only certain people, those with the appropriate licenses, would be able
to talk about certain things. You wouldn't be able to talk or write
about genetics unless you held licenses to use repressor and allele and
so forth. You couldn't discuss syntax without licenses for E-language
and foot feature and Determiner Phrase, and if you had them, you might
find that you couldn't use, say, functional unification and thematic
role in the same paper because of the restrictions in the licenses
imposed by the proponents of rival theories. The mind boggles at the
insanity of this idea.
