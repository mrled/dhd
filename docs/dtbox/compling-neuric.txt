"every time I fire a linguist, my recognition rates go up" 
"some of my best friends are linguists.:" 

sometimes, at companies, you have to do fairly dumb things in order to achieve results... by this I mean, some non-linguisticky things.


the state of the art parsers can tag correctly on 95-97% of the words.
the baseline parsers - doing no statistical, or complicated analysis, just taking the most common use (eg dog may be a verb, but is almost always a noun) - get about 90%. 
also, human taggers get about 97-98% accuracy. you can test this further... if your machine algorithm only "know" the previous, say, 3 words, show your human taggers only those previous 3 words. your parser may do very well compared to the human, when they are given the exact same information. 

there is also sentence-level scoring... so you would get 0 points for a sentence where one word is tagged incorrectly.
