*** Make some scripts that either do this for me, or generate aliases instead. 

Interix and IRIX are at least two systems which have commands available to them in inconvenient places. For instance, using Xming under Windows with Inerix's X clients, xhost.exe is in /dev/fs/C/Program Files/Xming/xhost.exe, and on top of that, I must specify the '.exe' part at the end of the command. In IRIX, /usr/etc has a lot of networking commands like ping and traceroute, but on my system there is at least one non-executable rc-file (which means I can't just add /usr/etc to my path). 

I'd like to fix that by either aliasing the commands within my shell, or symlinking them to a nice convenient place on the path, maybe even without the trailing .exe. 

If I'm running alias scripts, it's probably best to run them manually and dump them into ~/.tmp/aliases or something like that. If I run the alias-generating script at each shell startup, it will make startup very slow. 

** Examples: 
* ln -s /dev/fs/C/Programs/Xming /usr/Xming; ln -s /usr/Xming/*.exe /opt/Xming/*
* ln -s /dev/fs/C/Programs/MSVC /usr/local/MSVC; ln -s /usr/local/MSVC/*.exe /opt/MSVC/*
* gfind /etc /usr/etc -type f -perm -100 # finds all regular files which are executable by at least their owner
