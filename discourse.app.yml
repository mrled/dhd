## After making changes to this file, you MUST rebuild for any changes
## to take effect in your live Discourse instance:
##
## /var/discourse/launcher rebuild app
##
## Make sure to obey YAML syntax! You can use this site to help check:
## http://www.yamllint.com/

## this is the all-in-one, standalone Discourse Docker container template

# You may add rate limiting by uncommenting the web.ratelimited template.
# Out of the box it allows 12 reqs a second per ip, and 100 per minute per ip
# This is configurable by amending the params in this file

templates:
  - "templates/postgres.template.yml"
  - "templates/redis.template.yml"
  - "templates/web.template.yml"
  - "templates/sshd.template.yml"
  - "templates/web.ratelimited.template.yml"

## which TCP/IP ports should this container expose?
expose:
  - "3472:80"   # fwd host port 3472 (DISC) to container port 80 (http)

params:
  db_default_text_search_config: "pg_catalog.english"

  ## Set db_shared_buffers to a max of 25% of the total memory.
  ##
  ## On 1GB installs set to 128MB (to leave room for other processes)
  ## on a 4GB instance you may raise to 1GB
  db_shared_buffers: "128MB"
  #
  ## Set higher on large instances it defaults to 10MB, for a 3GB install 40MB is a good default
  ## this improves sorting performance, but adds memory usage per-connection
  #db_work_mem: "40MB"
  #
  ## Which Git revision should this container use? (default: tests-passed)
  #version: tests-passed

env:
  LANG: en_US.UTF-8

  # I have to do this because of FUCKING RUBY and FUCKING DISCOURSE
  # Older Rubies apparently don't fucking understand fucking SANs
  # And of course this is all in some idiot dockerfile managed by an idiotic shell script so...

## These containers are stateless, all data is stored in /shared
volumes:
  - volume:
      host: /var/discourse/shared/standalone
      guest: /shared
  - volume:
      host: /var/discourse/shared/standalone/log/var-log

## The docker manager plugin allows you to one-click upgrade Discourse

hooks:
  after_code:
    - exec:
        cd: $home/plugins
        cmd:
          - mkdir -p plugins
          - git clone https://github.com/discourse/docker_manager.git

## Remember, this is YAML syntax - you can only have one block with a name
run:
  - exec: echo "Beginning of custom commands"

  ## If you want to set the 'From' email address for your first registration, uncomment and change:
  #- exec: rails r "SiteSetting.notification_email='info@unconfigured.discourse.org'"
  ## After getting the first signup email, re-comment the line. It only needs to run once.

  ## If you want to configure password login for root, uncomment and change:
  ## Use only one of the following lines:
  #- exec: /usr/sbin/usermod -p 'PASSWORD_HASH' root
  #- exec: /usr/sbin/usermod -p "$(mkpasswd -m sha-256 'RAW_PASSWORD')" root

  ## If you want to authorized additional users, uncomment and change:
  #- exec: ssh-import-id username
  #- exec: ssh-import-id anotherusername

  - exec: echo "End of custom commands"
  - exec: awk -F\# '{print $1;}' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys | awk 'BEGIN { print "Authorized SSH keys for this container:"; } NF>=2 {print $NF;}'
