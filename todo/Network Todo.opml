            <outline text="I have a server with them for almost a year, and I've had an employer and a friend signup for servers with them.&#10;&#10;Things to know:&#10;You MUST be able to admin your server with MINIMAL support. If not, they'll get you on extras. (You only get one reboot a month, extras are $29/mo).&#10;You only get a few tickets a month, extras cost&#10;Excess bandwidth is expensive -- so be sure you won't use more -- or its not a good deal.&#10;Although its 100mbit/sec connection, if you want it uncapped (capped at 4Mbit/sec) you must request so -- and be held responsible if someone hacks your server and burns a ton of bandwidth.&#10;There are no extras -- no reboot ports (manual ticket), no serial console, etc.&#10;IPs are actually a pretty cool deal -- $10 one time fee, no extra monthly cost.&#10;You might want to consider the one-time extra fee for some more ram. I'm considering it, going forward.&#10;&#10;So -- for me for example, its an amazing solution.&#10;I use it for personal sites, I use minimal bandwidth, I can admin servers w/o issue, so I've never had to pay a SINGLE extra fee.&#10;It all depends on your needs. Even if you had to pay some extra fees once in a while, it'd likely still work out cheaper than going with a host charging near $100/mo for similar hardware/services.&#10;&#10;They also have a referral program, where you can get a free month of service for referring someone. So its been a nice bonus to signup my employer and friend with them, its a good match for them, at this price point.&#10;&#10;One day, if I decide to leave them -- it will be a bit of a hassle, they do have a difficult cancellation policy -- you must notify them 30 days in advance, in writing.&#10;&#10;Some advice:&#10;Setup MRTG to monitor your bandwidth usage&#10;Real all the agreements fully, Understand what you get, so you don't request extra tickets or reboots and get charged for it.&#10;If you're going to be using more than 400GB of bandwidth, you should probably consider going with someone like Hivelocity, who offers 1000GB boxes for $50/mo"/>
            <outline text="I used to run a content distribution service that consisted of 10-15 servers. Only 2 with them.&#10;Here's the problems.&#10;1. Support - If you screw up your box on a friday night it will not get fixed until Monday morning.&#10;2. If I didn't know any better, I would swear that their $29 dedicated server is really a VM. I would hash these large files 40GB and it would lock up the server. If this happened on the weekend forget it!&#10;3. Even though they say that you have 100Mbps connectivity OFF-NET it's more like 5120kbps (5Mbps)&#10;4. Pay attention to the bandwidth usage the overage charges will kill you. $X,XXX&#10;5. Pay attention to your bills!&#10;6. Trying to cancel the service is almost impossible."/>
